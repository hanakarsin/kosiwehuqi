Any appearance of national confusion, even if scripted without any basis, could fuel unreasoned confusion.</p><p>“We, therefore, call on Nigerians to be wary of manoeuvres by people who are desperate to erode the foundation of our hard-fought democracy to further the agenda of a desperate, bumptious and self-serving group of elites besotted with power to the point that they are ready to throw the country into a contrived pandemonium to remain relevant”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>denied any involvement</a></strong> in the killing of the former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls Gulak was shot dead by unknown gunmen in Owerri, Imo State on Saturday while he was on his way to Abuja from Owerri.</p><p>Explaining details of how Gulak was killed, the Imo State Police Public Relations Officer, <strong>SP Bala Elkana</strong> in a statement on Sunday said Gulak didn’t inform the Police or any other sister security agency of his movement.</p><p>Elkana added that the cab driver who took the politician to the airport avoided the normal route where they were attacked by six armed bandits.</p><p>However, some quarters are insinuating that IPOB is responsible for the killing of the top Northern politician but the group has now issued a denial.</p><p>IPOB said Gulak’s death is a political assassination.</p><p>IPOB also accused Imo State Governor, <strong>Hope Uzodinma</strong>, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) of knowing the circumstances behind the killing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5JpZp%2BnoqKys3nPq5ysoZSau7V5wJyarquVmXqwsoypo5qmo2LBsHnFqKmcnZaqua3FjKucpqemmnqjwceaqaJllqe8rnnOn52im5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
