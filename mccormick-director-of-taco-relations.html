One additional supplemental set of materials may be submitted, like a combined cover letter and resume, via a single Word or PDF file."</p><p>McCormick gave some context into the role as well, saying that any person hired for the task must be the "official eyes and ears for all things tacos. You’ll have the opportunity to work with the McCormick Kitchens team to develop innovative and delish taco recipes, travel across the country in search of the latest taco trends, dialogue with other like-minded taco connoisseurs across social media, and be in on the latest Street Taco seasoning mixes developed by the McCormick innovation lab."</p><p>The company says it is looking to engage in important dialogue surrounding taco culture, including asking the hardest-hitting question surrounding the food: Is the hard or soft shell taco better? The chosen candidate will engage with the company and its fans and have direct input into what taco-related products McCormick brings to shelves in the future.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by McCormick Spice (@mccormickspice)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The pay for the job is pretty substantial as well, and comes with some pretty cool benefits.</h2><p>If you're considering applying to this position to make a career out of it, think again, as McCormick has stipulated that the position will only be offered for four months. However, the company may have very well offered one of the best temporary employment contracts of all time, as the individual selected will be paid $100,000 for their time with the company.</p><p>Some simple math proves that to come in at $25,000 a month, just for vetting some taco recipes, which sounds like a pretty sweet deal. On top of that, McCormick isn't even asking candidates to relocate or work a full-time schedule; they'll only be required to report in 20 hours a week from a remote setting of their choice.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>McCormick is advertising for a director of taco relations (four-month, part-time gig work) to work on recipes, travel to famous taco restaurants, do social media.
