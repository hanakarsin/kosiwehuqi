Here's why her advice is receiving backlash.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images / Twitter / @reputushion</span></figure><p>There are two types of people in this world: those who love and respect the Kardashian-Jenner family, and those who don‚Äôt. Since <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> premiered on E! in 2007, the ladies have constantly been at the butt of jokes. They were easy targets. Particularly <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, whose first 15 minutes of fame came after a sex tape of her and her then-boyfriend <a href=#>Ray J</a> was leaked online.</p><p>But Kim is a different person now. She‚Äôs a mom of four who is working to <a href=#>become a lawyer</a>. She's a businesswoman who has helmed her own shapewear line (SKIMS) and beauty brand (KKW Beauty). Once just a TV personality, Kim has worked hard to change the public‚Äôs perception of her. But has she worked hard enough to start doling out career advice to other women? Perhaps not just yet.</p><p>In a March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Kim told the outlet: "I have the best advice for women in business. Get your f---ing ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days."</p><p>Later, when Variety shared a snippet of her business advice on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter,</a> the Internet went berserk. Folks began to criticize her view, finding her comment to be out of touch. Then came the memes and all of the sarcastic tweets poking fun at her. Keep scrolling to see what the internet thought of Kim's advice.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Kardashian is facing backlash for her business advice to women.</h2><p>As for what Kim said, it wasn't bad advice per se, but perhaps it would have been received better if someone else delivered it.</p><p>Many users on social media found her advice to be insensitive, considering she grew up in a well-known family in Beverly Hills with money. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was one of O.J. Simpson‚Äôs "Dream Team" attorneys.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kim kardashian giving business advice: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wU7AsCWMtA</a></p>‚Äî tusharüß¨ (@reputushion) <a href=#>March 10, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kim kardashian: nobody wants to work these days</p><p>everyone working 40+ hour weeks and earning minimum wage: no shit</p>‚Äî joe (@jxeker) <a href=#>March 9, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ugh I need to be more like Kim K, the only working woman in America!!!

She noted that she was poorly paid on the job, could only afford groceries from the 99 Cents Only Store, and once had to call out sick because she couldn't afford to put gas in her car.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was an editor on the Kardashian apps in 2015 in LA, worked days nights & weekends, could only afford groceries from the 99 Cents Only Store, called out ‚Äúsick‚Äù more than once bc I couldn‚Äôt put gas in my car to get to the office, & was reprimanded for freelancing on the side ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>https://t.co/mzvnTomjS3</a></p>‚Äî Jessica DeFino (@jessicadefino_) <a href=#>March 9, 2022</a></figure><p>So will Kim's business advice live on? Will it be printed inside planners and on stationery? Most likely, no. But at least it did inspire a few people ... to create memes and make jokes.
