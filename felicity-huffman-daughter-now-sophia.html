Macy took to Instagram to announce the news by changing her bio to read “CMU Drama ‘24." Looks like Sophia’s looking to follow in the footsteps of her talented parents and will matriculate into the Pennsylvania-based university’s drama program.&nbsp;</p><p>The aspiring actress has had a tough year to say the least. Her high school graduation was marred by the breaking of the admissions scandal, and while Sophia Grace had no idea about her mother’s actions, her tarnished SAT scores caused her first-choice college to rescind their acceptance offer despite the fact that they didn’t even require SAT scores in the first place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dean Buscher/CBS</span></figure><p>But Sophia proved herself completely capable of getting into a prestigious college program all by herself. Over the past year, the 19-year-old re-took the SATs, and based on her new scores, she was admitted into Carnegie Mellon University.&nbsp;</p><p>A source close to the Huffman-Gacy family told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> that, “Felicity is so proud and grateful that Sophia has kept her chin up over the last year. It was a painful, challenging time and she pulled through it with strength and grace.”</p><p>Sophia clearly has some innate acting talent as well. The highly selective Carnegie Mellon program has an acceptance rate of only 5 percent, and every student goes through a rigorous admissions process that includes a review of academic and standardized testing scores, as well as an in-person audition monologue.&nbsp;</p><p>Sophia’s acceptance is a testament to hard work and rising above challenges.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sophia’s acting career is already underway.</h2><p>Despite not having even started her first semester at college, Sophia's resume is already stacking up with some enviable roles. Back in January, the young star uploaded a poster of Jordan Peele’s anthology series The Twilight Zone with an excited caption that read, “Been wanting to talk about this for a MINUTE!”&nbsp;</p><p>Sophia's first major role will see her star as Irene in an episode titled “Among the Untrodden."&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations and enjoy college, Sophia Grace!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7KttcKiq7JlmKqzp7nAp2SdmaWctbWx0WalqK9dqLyxtMia</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
