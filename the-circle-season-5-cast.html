But, luckily for us, that day is not today and The Circle's <a href=#>Season 5</a> cast features all singles for the first time ever.</p><p>OK, maybe some of them are just pretending to be single, but still.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Circle isn't a dating show, but Season 5, which premieres on the streaming platform on Dec. 28, may feel like that for some of its <a href=#>cast members</a> this time around. Like other seasons, we have a group of strangers sequestered in their individual apartments.</p><p>They communicate with each other through online chats and each week, they vote for the best and worst players. Season 5 features the same format and a brand new batch of contestants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brett Robinson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You might recognize Brett from Big Brother 20. He's back on reality TV in The Circle to try and use his winning personality to once again win over some of the other players. Time will tell how well that goes for him, though.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@brettwrobinson</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brian Clark aka Brittney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Season 5's Brian is playing The Circle as his daughter, Brittney, who is also a single mom. Maybe he hopes to tug at the heartstrings of some of the other players, but we all know that an older person catfishing as a much younger player sometimes doesn't end well.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@worldwidebri</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shubham Goel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shubham is an unexpected Season 5 cast member on The Circle. He was the<a href=#> runner-up in Season 1</a> and he has remained something of a fan favorite in the series. In fact, Netflix didn't even reveal him as part of the cast until Dec. 12. Obviously, expectations are high, so hopefully he brings his A-game to take home the win this time.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@shubham_goell</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Billie-Jean Blackett aka Bruno</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Billie-Jean is another Season 5 catfish. She's playing the game as a man named Bruno.

On the show, Chaz might need to do a little more work to prove he's someone to work with rather than a threat to anyone's game.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@thatshampoopapi</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marvin Achi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nigerian-born Marvin is a chemical engineer, but by looking at him, you might instead guess bodybuilder or a professional athlete in the making.</p><p>His physique will either gain favor among those who are attracted to him or make him an instant target in The Circle. He was also almost on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Brother 24</a>, but he was replaced at the last minute.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@marvinachi</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oliver TwiXt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There's a possibility that you already know Oliver from Season 5 of The Circle. He was in The TS Madison Experience on WE tv before Netflix came calling.</p><p>He's also known for sharing social media interviews with America's Next Top Model cast members.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@heisolivertwixt</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Raven Sutton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Raven, who already had more than 48,000 Instagram followers before Season 5 of The Circle even premiered, is a disability advocate and a deaf performer. She's also the first deaf contestant in the series so far, which makes her something of a trailblazer.</p><p>And she's here with her friend, Paris, to help translate for her and support her along the way.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@bluejay19xx</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sam is a proud Brooklyn native with a selfie game that's on point. And honestly, Sam will need to make sure those selfies are up to snuff if she wants to gain favor among her fellow Circle players right away.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@bkshedevil</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tasia aka Tamira</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although Tasia is playing The Circle as Tamira, she may accidentally let her own values, which include being proud of her sexuality and her support of the Black Lives Matter movement, slip out. And none of that is a bad thing. Let's just hope she can keep her story straight, whatever it is.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@t_stonier</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Houghton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Outside of The Circle, Tom is a London-based comedian. He has quite a following, so maybe Billie-Jean, who is also from London, will be familiar with his work. Either way, hopefully, his humor helps him gain popularity among his Circle peers.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@honourabletom</strong></a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Xanthi Perdikomatis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Xanthi is a model, so she's no stranger to a solid glamour shot or the right Instagram angles. The only thing she'll have to worry about is whether or not the other players assume she's a catfish.</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@xanthijoanna</strong></a></p><p>Watch The Circle on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecKiqZyklWLApq3SqKVmbV2YrrTA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
