She studied to be a lawyer after all, and her late father, Robert Kardashian, was a respected attorney. So when Kim says in <a href=#>The Kardashians</a> series premiere that she thinks she needs to sue Roblox for using her likeness in a game, it probably shouldn't be taken lightly.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kim expresses concern when her son, Saint West, shows her a game in the online platform game Roblox in which the crying face meme of her is used.

It was called Kim Kardashian: Superstar. Although Kim filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment in 2007, she eventually dropped the suit and settled with the company for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a>. That same year, Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered on E! for the first time.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a>, Kim and Ray J both still make hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in residuals from Vivid Entertainment thanks to the sales of the tape.

But the bigger issue is that the game within Roblox promises sex tape footage, of which she's sure there isn't any.</p><p>Her tape was leaked years ago and, as far as Kim knows, there's no secret unreleased footage to speak of.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It doesn't look like Kim actually sued Roblox.
