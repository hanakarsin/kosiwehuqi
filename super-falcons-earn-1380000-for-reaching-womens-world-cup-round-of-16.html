That spot has automatically qualified them for round 16 where they will earn an additional $30,000 each.</p><p>This means that all the Super Falcons players have earned $60,000 each which is equivalent to N46.2 million based on Monday’s exchange rate.</p><p>They will keep earning an additional $30,000 as they progress in the competition which means that they will earn a whopping $165,000 each if they make it to the semi-finals.</p><p>And if they manage to win the 2023 Women’s World Cup, each member of the Super Falcons squad will go home with a whopping $270,000 as prize money. If they finish second, they will earn $195,000, and if they finish third, they will earn $180,000 each.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49qZqytoJq%2FbrLApZqopqNisqK%2BzWZobHBgZX1xecWoqWaqlZawqbXNoGSwp52au7R51qippZxdmMKxedGorKecXaSzbn2VaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
