From jeggings to kitten heels, there are <a href=#>some trends</a> that should really stay in the past.</p><p>But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@leahbbeth</a> said she’s reminded of her past every day when she looks in the mirror. In a viral <a href=#>TikTok</a>, she explained why she wishes she could go back in time. According to Leah, she’d give her younger self a few words of advice about getting tattoos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@leahbbeath</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Woman really regrets getting tattoos: “I just don't feel at home in this skin anymore.”</h2><p>Thanks to years of hard work and dedicated <a href=#>tattoo artists</a>, most of Leah’s body is covered in ink. Now that she’s all grown up, she’s full of regret and warns young people to wait until they’re at least 25 to get tatted.</p><p>“When you were a teenager and you were like, 'This is not a phase Mom, this is the real me.' It was a phase,” she explains in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the video</a>.</p><p>Although she started on her latest piece as recently as “last year,” she’s already second-guessing her decision.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@leahbbeth href=#>@leahbbeth</a><p>The minimum age for tattoos should be 25 i said what i said 👁️👄👁️ I love the idea of tattoos but i don’t love most of mine tbh 🥲 bin meee <a title=tattooremoval href=#>#tattooremoval</a> <a title=tattooregret href=#>#tattooregret</a> <a title=tattooregrets href=#>#tattooregrets</a> <a title=tattoosleeveremoval href=#>#tattoosleeveremoval</a> <a title=itwasaphase href=#>#itwasaphase</a> <a title=grwm href=#>#grwm</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Leem" href=#>♬ original sound - Leem</a></figure><p>Leah said “something just switched” in her head weeks ahead of her 25th birthday. “There really is something to be said about brain development and decision-making,” Leah said.</p><p>The TikToker added: “Like I woke up one day and I was like I am cringing the eff out about the majority of my tattoos, most of them do not bring me joy.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@leahbbeath</a></figure><p>Leah showed off some of her tats, which stretch from her shoulders to her feet. For her, most of them “have no meaning” and don’t represent the woman she is now. She also gave us some insight into why she inked her whole body in the first place.</p><p>“I think I was looking for a sense of identity and outward validation from other people. I just don't feel like at this point in my life that I crave that attention and validation anymore,” she said, adding that she wishes she could “scrub them all off.”</p><p>Leah also shared: “I just don't feel at home in this skin anymore.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@leahbbeath</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The woman shares why young people should wait until they turn 25 to get tattoos.</h2><p>Additionally, Leah made another bad decision in her youth: she got a botched breast augmentation.</p><p>“My advice to you is, wait until you're older than 25 to get tattoos or make any changes to your body,” she warned.</p><p>And she isn’t the only one who feels this way. Her story resonated with plenty of users on TikTok, who shared their perspectives in the comments.</p><p>“I waited until I was 30 to start getting tattoos — so relieved,” @strawberryvino wrote. “Some of my friend’s tattoos are rough. I also have [money] for quality artists!”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@leahbbeath</a></figure><p>Another person empathized: “Same ... I want all mine gone too. Why did I do this to myself?”</p><p>On the other hand, there were plenty of users who didn’t regret their tattoos at all. “If it helps I'm 50 and wish I never got mine removed. Thinking of getting new ones,” @mattiehac commented.</p><p>Remember, it’s your body so it’s your choice! But maybe you should wait until you’re old enough to drink to make that decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mqZ6foprBtHnHnqlmrJGpwbC70g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
