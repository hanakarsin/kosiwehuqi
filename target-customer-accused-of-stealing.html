Claims their machine has not been scanning all items and they need to count my items to make sure they all scanned."</p><p>The TikTok begins with Alexis asking the Target employee to get a manager, to which the employee replies that they are the manager before interacting with the machine. A quick video pan reveals that Alexis' baby is with them in the shopping cart.</p><p>The store manager then begins to take an item out of Alexis' cart in order to check the machine to ensure that it's scanning properly. However, Alexis tells the manager that she believes she's being accused of stealing and that the employee is only saying that the scanner is faulty as an excuse to inspect her cart.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@blexxican_ href=#>@blexxican_</a><p>Target in Delray beach Florida.

More than likely she is referencing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart customer's experience</a> at a self-checkout counter, where a shopper who was charged with theft over a machine error was awarded $2.1 million.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @blexxican_</span></figure><p>Alexis then goes on to call the situation "f***ing ridiculous" and points out the fact that there are a number of people waiting in line who are being held up because of the employee's actions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @blexxican_</span></figure><p>She goes on to call the entire situation "embarrassing" and at this point the worker offers to take her to another area in order to process the rest of her transaction. She says that she simply wanted to "scan and pay" and doesn't want to do that, so the employee continues to scan as she curses again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @blexxican_</span></figure><p>The woman then asks for the name of the Target manager along with his name as well. She then asks him to "be honest" and tell her whether or not they have been stopping all other customers who used this kiosk about the malfunctioning scanner and inspected their carts.</p><p>He doesn't answer her question and instead tells her that he's placing the bags right back in the cart. She asks him to answer her question. The employee informs her that he will give her the district manager's phone number to discuss the matter to which Alexis replies that she already has it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @blexxican_</span></figure><p>She then asks for another contact number of a general manager/owner she can call and he informs her that he'll get her that number at the end of the video.</p><p>A number of TikTokers expressed their shock at the treatment Alexis received and stated that they would've been upset as well. Some even said that they wouldn't have given the location their business and would've opted to visit another store after being inconvenienced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6zs8StZJyto6m8rrHRZpicm6WosqV5zp9krKyVlrmqusY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
