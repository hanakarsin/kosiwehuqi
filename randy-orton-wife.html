Kim apparently used to joke with friends that she would one day meet and then marry "The Viper" Randy Orton.</p><p>The two met in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., at an event while she was a member of his fan club. Randy apparently spotted her in the crowd at the event and introduced himself. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>In an interview after their marriage, Kim said that she felt attached to Randy before the two even met. "In my brain, way before I met Randy, he was my boyfriend," she told Renee Young. The two dated for a few months, and Randy ultimately proposed during a romantic trip to Bora Bora.</p><p>The two were married just three months after their engagement on Nov. 14, 2015, and Kim's three sons as well as Randy's daughter were all in attendance.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Randy Orton (@randyorton)</a></p></figure><p>Randy also said that, in spite of Kim's joking desire to date him which went back years, she would lie about their relationship early on in part to avoid the attention that would come with being his girlfriend. Since their relationship went public, she has occasionally faced outrage from fans, although that outrage seems to have, at least generally speaking, been over next to nothing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How many kids do Randy and Kim have?</h2><p>Kim was married once before her marriage to Randy, but she has not offered a lot of detail on that marriage. We do know, though, that she had three children with her first husband: Anthony, Robbie, and Michael. Randy also has a daughter named Alana from his first marriage to gymnast Samantha Speno.</p><p>Kim and Randy also have a child together, who they welcomed in 2016, named Brooklyn Rose Orton.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Randy Orton (@randyorton)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@randyorton</span></figure><p>Generally speaking, their large blended family seem to work well together, and Randy and Kim's marriage has mostly been smooth sailing.</p><p>There was a little flair up of drama in 2021 after a fellow wrestler named Alexa Bliss got a little too up close and personal with Randy in the ring during an intergender fight.</p><p>Kim called Alexa out on Twitter, telling her that she might have just "f--ked up, little girl." Nothing more came of the callout, but it seems like Kim is willing to passionately defend her relationship, even if she's not in the ring herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66vsNhmpqusn6N6uLXFnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
