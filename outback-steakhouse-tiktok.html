Let's say you're grabbing some early breakfast on a road trip, or you need a place to sober up after a night of drinking: <a href=#>Waffle House</a> is where it's at.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now if you've got the money to pick a fancy place for a special occasion, then a lot of folks would probably urge you to select a fine-dining establishment that more than likely has a prix fixe menu.</p><p>However, there are some sit-down chain restaurants that brand themselves as "splitting the difference" between a diner/fast food joint and a super fancy affair. While the atmosphere is a little nicer than McDonalds, and the meal will probably taste better, the food preparation at these chain restaurants, like Outback Steakhouse, is a point of contention for many.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That's because, unlike McDonald's, one can very easily rack up a fairly large bill at an Outback. If you're used to frequenting more premiere steakhouses, $31 for a porterhouse seems like a steal, but at a chain restaurant, that's a high price for an entree. Add appetizers and drinks to the meal and you're looking at a hefty ticket.</p><p>One would assume that if they're paying a decent amount of money for a side of lobster with their steak, they're hopefully getting some expertly-prepared grub.</p><p>However, TikToker @dirtdawg420 has made a habit of "outing" some chain restaurants's cooking practices, just in case there are some folks out there who believe they're getting a gourmet experience for their money.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dirtdawg420</span></figure><p>In another one of his trending clips, he takes out sliced lobster from a fridge and microwaves it. Afterwards, he seasons the food with some paprika and butter. While preparing the shellfish, he says, "This is that gourmet s--t. It's some fresh steamed lobsters there [sic]."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He previously went viral on the platform for showing how he cooks multiple steaks at one time on a grill if there's a huge dinner rush. He also showed the absolute mess of a kitchen at a Cheddar's restaurant when a food expo ended up quitting mid-shift.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dirtdawg420</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many TikTok users were taken aback by some of the kitchen processes, like the fact that the lobster was left near the steak, risking possible cross-contamination of food items.</p><p>Others pointed to the viral TikTok as an example of why they cook at home. User @matt3187 writes, "Save money and cook way better food than any of these restaurants."</p><p>Other folks were impressed by @dirtdawg420's audacity, but also thought that his constant posting would eventually result in him being out of a job. "Watch out on social media. Outback will let you go if you aren't careful," @craigdanielss wrote.</p><p>What do you think?
