They are just good looking guys from a well cultured part of Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>We understand you may have personal beef for them as they are most ladies' favorites with their unending uniqueness and ‘swags’. But the populace as a whole does not give Yoruba boys much choice when it comes to their heart-breaking moves. Ladies seem to be all over them and do not give them the chance to miss other ladies who sashayed out of their lives.</p><p class=align-left>Lol, do not shoot me. That was on a lighter note. But as a matter of fact, these guys are irresistible. Ask any lady around you about her love history and there is bound to be some ‘Femi’, ‘Kunle’, or ‘Wale’ in her life.</p><p class=align-left>Let us move on from here and see the interesting part of dating Yoruba boys:</p><p class=h4>1. They could be loyal</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt4p34v2ps9l3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Now what makes Yoruba boys different from every other guy out there? Men cheat, lie and play girls. The fact that a cheating guy is from that tribe in Nigeria does not mean every other Yoruba boy would be just the same.</p><p class=align-left>Hausa boys also act smart on some unsuspecting Aisha and Halima. And an Igbo boy may be sleeping with Nnenna and Nkechi at the same time. Duhhhhhhh!</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;7 incredible people you won't believe really exist (PHOTOS)</p><p class=h4>2. They are interesting</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1h4gbi7mnvm.jpeg><p class=align-left>Do you know the amount of fun you could have dating a Yoruba boy? Well, Yoruba boys are so interesting they turn up at almost every event. Ever seen them showing up at an engagement ceremony? You would love to follow one home immediately. And when you finally have a son, you would love to dress him up the Yoruba way.</p><p class=h4>3. They are passionate</p><p class=align-left>Okay, I know many ladies hate Yoruba boys right now; however, have you thought of the reason why ladies want to kill themselves over them? They are passionate and they know how to do ‘IT’ well. &nbsp;Yes, I know you know what I am talking about. Even Yoruba men in their sixties no dey carry last.</p><p class=h4>4. They are everywhere</p><p class=align-left>Yoruba boys are well-informed; being on Twitter and other social platforms do not make them jobless. They are just guys that are ‘in town’. They know what is happening around them and love to stay informed.</p><p class=align-left>Dear Ladies, do not be angry when a Yoruba boy turns out to be the first person to retweet your post. They know you love attention and want to give it to you. Stop forming hard to please when you secretly enjoy it. Tongue out!</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;6 things you shouldn't do after a breakup but still end up doing</p><p class=h4>5. They appreciate good friendship</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt154g2lb8bkp.jpeg><p class=align-left>So what is wrong in finding a group of Yoruba boys at a time? If farmers have association and hair dressers can do meetings from time to time, why can’t Yoruba boys hang out and have fun together? Go and sit down my friend. Find another reason to hate them.</p><p class=h4>6. They are ‘repping in-laws’</p><p class=align-left>Your brother turns up in the city where you live and he is stuck staying at home watching football alone? This would NEVER happen when you are married to a Yoruba boy. You know how they say ‘Gbogbo aiye foreign’, they are going to give him a swell time you would be so proud of being married to them.</p><p class=align-left>If you behave well you are going to be a partaker of that fun. My sister, ‘make head stand still’ and enjoy being with a Yoruba boy. Winks.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHqFknJpZm5dnru1sdGeqq2hnpx6p63CrapmnJGptq%2BzjLKmq62Slnqju9isZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
