Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s former Head of State has expressed confidence that Nigerians will vote out the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015.</strong></p><p>The former head of state, who hinged his confidence on what he termed PDP’s misrule said he would seek the ticket of his All Progressives Congress (APC) party to contest for president.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Why 2015 Elections Will Be Tough- Buhari</p><p>Speaking to The Nation on Tuesday in Ado Ekiti, the capital of Ekiti State, he further expressed confidence that Nigerians were tired of the PDP and will definitely vote them out next year and end the party’s misrule.</p><p>Gen. Buhari, who was also at Ado Ekiti, to inaugurate the Ekiti Parapo Square, a 12,000-seater capacity pavilion built by the outgoing Governor Kayode Fayemi administration further reiterated his presidential ambition.</p><p>It was gathered that the event signals the beginning of the winding down of the Fayemi administration as Governor-elect Ayo Fayose is expected to take over on October 16, 2014.

Buhari at the occasion called on electorate to use their voter cards purposely to usher in a new regime of hope and progress. He said only the resolve of the electorate could end what he termed PDP’s misrule.</p><p><i>“It is no doubt that Nigerians have been traumatised under the PDP leadership and Nigeria will be in trouble if we carry on the way the PDP has been doing in Nigeria. That is why it is important for the elite to talk to the less-privileged to collect their permanent voter cards in preparation for the 2015 elections. This is the only missile against the PDP tyranny.</i></p><p><i>“We must take this seriously because the APC is seriously determined to offer a better alternative platform for Nigerians. So, we have to be prepared for next year’s elections,”</i> Buhari said.</p><p>The former head of state lauded Fayemi’s administration for the success recorded so far, as shown in the quality and grade of the pavilion.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>APC Will End Corruption In Nigeria – Buhari</a></p><p><i>“I am indeed very happy to be part of this success story.

Muhammadu Buhari and former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, shared divers opinion over the procedure for adopting the 2015 presidential candidate for the party dispite the fact that former <a href=#>Vice President Atiku Abubakar had earlier declared his intention to run for presidency on September 24, 2014</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3qFk25nZpqlna6ztYysrKudXWd9coGMr6CcrJ%2Bnxm%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
