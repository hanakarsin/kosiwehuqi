He is such a professional. He came in and just killed it,” the English television personality shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. Kelly also admitted to being slightly anxious about taking Corinne’s place as the Beat Shazam DJ.</p><p>"It’s such an honor to be asked to step in and keep the seat warm while Corinne is away,” the Fashion Police star said. “It made me very nervous because she’s so beautiful and so good at what she does.
