We must advise our royal fathers that the function of royal fathers is that they are fathers to both the government in power and the opposition. They are not expected to be partisan</p><p>“They are some posts last week of some royal fathers intimidating those who want to vote and compelling them not to vote for the Labour Party, I will advise them to retract from taking such an attitude because there will be consequences for royal fathers who show partisanship in engaging the polity.</p><p>“We implore Lagos residents to ignore provocative posts on social media mainly enabled by agent provocateurs aimed at fanning the embers of disunity among the peace-loving residents and intended to pitch Yorubas against Igbos.</p><p>“Igbos voted for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in the South-East the same way many Yorubas decided to vote for Mr Peter Obi in Lagos and other states in the South-West. The issue that we are confronting is not a contest between Igbos and Yourubas; it is a contest of ideas, it is a contest of those who think we are at a stage where we need a change in the polity.</p><p>“The false narrative of Lagos being taken over by Igbos is a false narrative. Mr Gbadebo is a Yoruba man. Lagos is not a no man’s land, it’s a Yoruba territory. (<a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.top5.com/</a>)</p><p>“We assure Lagosians that the government of Rhodes-Vivour will comprise indigenous Lagosians as well as provide and ensure that all ethnic nationalities are afforded their basic rights to ensure that they contribute to the continued growth of the city of Lagos that is the 5th largest economy in Africa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGh%2Bm5mUmq%2BwebGhpp2do2KjqsLOrqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
