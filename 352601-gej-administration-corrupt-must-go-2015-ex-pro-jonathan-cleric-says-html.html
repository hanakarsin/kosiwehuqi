Father Camillus Ejike Mbaka, blasted President Goodluck Jonathan over his helplessness in the war against&nbsp;corruption and inability to stop killings of innocent people in Nigeria.</strong></p><p class=align-left>DailyTrust reports that the cleric, who used to be a supporter of the incumbent president, expressed criticism during a sermon with the topic “From Good luck to Bad luck” at the Adoration Ground, Emene, Enugu, in the night of December 31, 2014, Wednesday.</p><p class=align-left>According to Rev. Mbaka, the president has surrounded himself with very corrupt public officials and keeps turning a blind eye to their corrupt activities. As a result, millions of Nigerians live in abject poverty and endless insecurity.</p><p class=align-left><i>“Jonathan has ruled for six years. We need change. NEPA is not working because of corruption. The privatization of public companies has not yielded any fruit because of corruption. Nigerians are sick and tired of wasting innocent lives without government doing enough to stop the destruction,”</i> he said.</p><p class=align-left>Rev. Mbaka, who is also a Founder of the Adoration Ministry, Enugu, reminded the congregation of more than 30,000 worshippers about the abduction of the Chibok girls, saying that the tragedy proves the government <i>“cannot guarantee the welfare, safety and security of the citizens”</i>.</p><p class=align-left>In general the cleric is known for his good attitude to the Jonathans. He anointed Dame Patience Jonathan as the next First Lady in 2015. The First Lady and the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, worshipped at the Adoration Ministry where Jonathan's wife admitted that she experienced “a spiritual rebirth.” The founder of the Ministry on the same day released some birds which, he said, would go and fight for Jonathan. However, his rhetorics was not too friendly during during the end-of-year mass.</p><p class=align-left>Rev. Mbaka recalled that one of the birds released during First Lady's visit, had refused to fly. He thinks this could signify that Jonathan was going nowhere after the February elections.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>How to play Baba Ijebu lotto?</a></p><p class=align-left><i>“All the other birds I released flew away but the healthiest of them which is Jonathan’s bird could not fly. I tried to make it fly but it could not fly,”</i> he said leaving the congregation confused and excited at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>The cleric added that in 2011 he was happy, like millions of other Nigerians. Unfortunately, the bad luck which the nation had faced since Jonathan entered the Aso Rock was “quite disturbing”. Therefore the masses desire a change.</p><p class=align-left><i>“Nigerians are calling for change. We need a change.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“We don’t want to move from bad luck to bad luck; Nigerians want to move from bad luck to good luck,”</i> he said.</p><p class=align-left>Rev. Mbaka condemned some of his colleagues who, according to him, visited the Aso Rock, other Governmental residences in Nigeria to hold “Breakfast Prayer” with the politicians only. He is sure they do so just to collect “fat envelopes of money” rather than to talk about the problems of the poor:</p><p class=align-left><i>“The men of God only go there to dine and wine with the leaders for their own welfare without telling them the truth. But I’m happy that I, Fr. Mbaka, I’m not that type of priest. If you want money, I dash you money because the God I serve has blessed me abundantly.”</i></p><p class=align-left>The&nbsp;Adoration Ministry Founder further expressed his opinion about Jonathan's opponent, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd.):</p><p class=align-left><i>“I don’t know Buhari. I have never sat with him before. I am not being partisan, but I want total change in Nigeria.&nbsp;</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Buhari cannot make Nigeria an Islamic country because we are in democracy. It was IBB government that dragged Nigeria into OIC. When Buhari fought corruption, people became careful about their actions. Anyone who says Buhari will Islamise Nigeria is not being fair.”</i></p><p class=align-left>Finally, the cleric noted that the ethno-religious origin of the president does not really matter as long as the leader of the country fights corruption and brings welfare for the citizens.</p><p class=align-left><i>“If a northerner will rule the country and insecurity will stop, so be it. If a Yoruba man will rule Nigeria in 2015 and we have peace and stop the shedding of innocent blood, so be it. Nigerians are tired of wasting innocent lives,”</i> he concluded.</p><p class=align-left>See the first part of the sermon and read the transcript, provided by PremiumTimes:</p><p></p><p class=align-left>In the year 2014, we had a lot of bloodshed in this country. People were dying like rats without anybody asking about them. This country suffered a lot of blood experience. Many of us witnessed that people were in tears. Just like the ancient world, the year 2014, the 4 in it had the queen in it, which had to do with death. Our leaders failedus with reckless abandon and nobody asked them question.</p><p class=align-left>The so-called democracy was a hidden autocracy. It was deceptive and questionable quack miler. Nigerians suffered hunger unnecessarily. We heard about oil subsidy being removed and added, whatever be(is) their jargon, nobody understood them. We heard about minimum wage, the civil servant suffered, the minimum wage was not paid and we were all calm. In 2015, Nigerians will not be calm again (shouts of AMEN!).</p><p class=align-left>We need change. Whatever it will be, let it be. This is my golden message to my beloved country. What actually is happening (Ogini nne me?). The multitude of our youths, the quality young men, quality young women, brilliants youths but nobody has plans for any of you. Our so-called leaders should come and apologize. In 2015, it shall not continue like that (shouts of AMEN).</p><p class=align-left>By the grace of God, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are announcing spiritually, change! 2015 should not be a year of any hooligan maneuvering to hijack power. This is our New Year message. Listen, when you go home, tell anybody you see that from the oracle of the Holy Spirit, we are announcing change (AMEN). Can somebody help me to shout change (shouts of change by the congregation) in Jesus holy name.</p><p class=align-left>Look at what it’s like, as I’m yet to bless your families, bless your industries, bless your destinies. Come 2015, your plans are blessed, your vision are blessed, your locomotive society are blessed. I cover this year with the blood of Jesus. I seal this year with the blood of Jesus.</p><p class=align-left>My message is in two branches (folds). Number one branch, the theme of this first message to my fellow countrymen is from good luck to bad luck. Once upon a time, the whole countrymen were crying for a leader who will help us move forward with our economy, have an authentic democracy, give our unemployed youths jobs, enable our power to be steady, who will industrialize Nigerians, who will encourage mass education and agriculturalize Nigeria. Having in view that oil will soon drop, give us security in a maximum level. By the grace of God, there emerged a Goodluck, all of us were happy, the Goodluck met Yar’ Adua and Yar’ Adua died. May the Holy Spirit help me as I utter this message, I know many will misunderstand it, but it will stand the test of time and you will know I’m speaking the truth.</p><p class=align-left>The Goodluck met Yar’Adua and Yar’Adua died. Before you know it, the Goodluck met our oil and the oil had a bad luck and poured away, before we knew it, the Goodluck met our naira, our naira had a bad luck. Where are we going? What is the fate of this country? Shall we continue like this, we need change (shout of change from the congregation).</p><p class=align-left>As I’m speaking with you, most of our civil servants did not celebrate their Christmas. The Christmas season that should be a Goodluck time became a bad luck time for our Nigerians forgetting that very soon, from 3rd January, the children will go back to school and the parent are going to pay school fees. From where? Are they going to use their urine to pay? (Shout of NO from the congregation). But where is the good water even if they are going to use their urine. Are they going to use their stool to pay the school fees of their children? (Shout of NO from the congregation). You have to eat well to defecate.</p><p class=align-left>What is the fate of our children? Tears fill my eyes when I see our young graduates hoping and walking our streets. What is the meaning of kidnapping? Kidnapping is the grandson of unemployment. Boko Haram is a grand great child of the same unemployment, mass looting, and poor governance.</p><p class=align-left>I’m not saying that Goodluck is a bad man. He is a good man. But he cannot lead Nigeria. As things stand right now, from the oracle of the Holy Spirit, Jonathan should honourably resign quietly and let Nigeria be. The destiny of Nigeria is greater than Goodluck Jonathan. The Goodluck in Jonathan has become a bad luck to Nigerians. Whatever brought him in should send him back and let Nigeria be.</p><p class=align-left>By this time in few months to come, many are going to lose their jobs and there is no alternative. During election, Jonathan will answer Azikiwe, Ebele and become an Igbo man and after election, the Ebele, the Azikiwe and Goodluck will vanish from his identity. Who is fooling who actually?</p><p class=align-left>Look at our federal roads, we are not even asking for new ones, roads built by Buhari and Babangidas –&nbsp;the so called Hausa people –&nbsp;cannot be maintained. Follow Enugu here to Onitsha, children born some years ago do not know that there was a lane along the other side of Isiagwu and we are all saying continue. The continuity of Jonathan means disaster to Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>We need change. May the Holy Spirit help me to vocalize what he has shown to me while I was waiting on him to give me a message for my people? I’m worried about the future of you my children. Go to school, go to school, mention any government school functioning in Nigeria now? Our schools are dilapidated. Nigeria is like an egg about to break in the hands of Jonathan Goodluck and we cannot allow it to happen. It is so unfortunate that pastors are becoming vultures around the president. Pastors are becoming hawks around him, eating the porridge of Jacob and selling their prophetic rights. And anointing is being merchandised in Aso Rock, carrying our nairas, turning it to dollars and carrying it in jets moving out of the country.</p><p class=align-left>Listen, this is the voice on the pulpit: all these men of God, who are telling Jonathan to continue because they are benefitting one thing or the other, you should question your apostolic, prophetic anointing. What the Bible say is that Samson did not know that the Holy Spirit had left him. Let them watch if the Holy Spirit is still in them.</p><p class=align-left>Listen, they will begin to tell us this one is a Christian the other one is a Muslim. I don’t believe in that. Who is a Christian more than Judas? Did Judas not betray Jesus? Judas was not just a Christian, he was not just a mere apostle, he was a super apostle like a cardinal but at a time he messed up and Bible says his office, let another take. That is the normal thing.</p><p class=align-left>The way Nigeria is going right now, the office of Goodluck Jonathan let another take. I’m not campaigning for anybody. I’m filled with tears over what is happening in Nigeria. Some of us who have nongovernmental organisations funding charity, I know what I’m suffering. The more they are looting our resources, the more they are rending you unemployed, the more some of us suffer the more. If I have been paying for the school fees of 500 people, it would now jack up to 3000, or more.</p><p class=align-left>What the government should do, individuals are struggling to achieve. When there is no road, no power, all this fake promises… where is the power? That Onitsha Bridge, has it now been built? No. After 6 years, and Goodluck has what it takes to do whatever. He surrounded himself with hooligans. By the time he comes down, he won’t have anybody to work with. He played himself into the hands of hooligans.</p><p class=align-left>My interest is about the wellness of this country. Nigeria must survive what we are passing through by the help of God. The same God who saved us from Ebola will save us from this bad luck season (shouts of AMEN from the congregation).</p><p class=align-left>Look at it, there was a time there was an argument about pension fund – such billions. Who is talking about it now? Billions and we were hearing it… from excess crude oil money, where is the impact of the excess crude oil money? Now from oil boom, it has met a bad luck; it’s now oil doom. If my father will be my leader and my siblings will all die, let a stranger be my leader and let my family be. All I’m trying to tell you is that we have not entered into any covenant with anybody.</p><p class=align-left>Last time, the First Lady came here. We are not partisan; we welcomed her. We did a spiritual drama here. Lifted four birds to fly up, the main one that should fly up refused to go. I did everything possible and that one is the healthiest of them all but refused to fly and the spirit of God said, don’t disturb him.</p><p class=align-left>When God rejected Saul, David took over. Let me tell you, in the history of Nigeria, we have never experience bloodshed as we have in the time of Goodluck. If Goodluck means bloodshed for Nigerians are you waiting until your own blood is shed? (shouts of No from the congregation).</p><p class=align-left>We need change, however God will do it. Look at the insecurity if you go to the northern part of Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>My fellow priest, my fellow pastors, don’t just stand up to attack this message, because you have mouth. Think well before you put your mouth, the voice is beyond your own contribution. Listen, are you waiting for your own church to be bombed before you speak out? If you go to Maiduguri, some parishes have closed down. Go to Potiskum. People no longer go to church on Sundays in many parts of this country. Now imagine a scenario where a president cannot fight a simple insurgence. This is not an external country attack o. It is not like another country invaded Nigeria. It is an intra distraction. And many of us are claiming that it was because Buhari said that he was going to make Jonathan’s government ungovernable. Listen, let’s assume Buhari said something like that, even though it’s not Buhari who said it. So if you are the president and somebody say something like that, will you not arrest such a person?</p><p class=align-left>To be continued...</p><p class=align-left>It would be noted that the Adoration mass on December 31st was attended by some notable politicians from Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu&nbsp;States.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHZ%2BlWloZp%2BVn3qisMyipaKrpKeutbXOp2Scp6KnwrHAjKasrKxdnLxufo9qbGadqGK9s7uMo6anmaSdrq95wqWcq6GTYsCixdJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
