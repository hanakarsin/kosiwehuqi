Well, on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, at least.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Rockstar Games</span></figure><p>Rockstar Games announced that online support for the title that tons of people are enjoying on those consoles will be taken offline. If you've got a PS4 or Xbox One, then you should be fine, and of course, if you're playing the title on your PC, you've got nothing to worry about.</p><p>Gamers will still be able to play the single-player mode of Grand Theft Auto V, but they just won't be able to enjoy online gaming modes. Oh, and if you have any in-game currency or items you purchased with you know, actual dollars, those won't carry over to other versions of the game. And you can't get a refund for them either, or for the game itself.</p><p>Again, this is only for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the title.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bad idea, let players enjoy in all platforms, do not force them to change their games for the new generation, perhaps some do not have enough money</p>— ☆ 𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐖𝐀𝐍𝐈 🇴🇲 (@mar__wani) <a href=#>June 16, 2021</a></figure><p>Rockstar discussed its decision to shut down GTA Online for this specific user base: "As we continue to move forward with updates and support for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of Grand Theft Auto Online — as well as prepare for this fall's launches of the new expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S — the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of GTA Online, including website stat tracking via the Rockstar Games Social Club, will officially be shutting down on December 16."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>GTA Online for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Will Shut Down on December 16, 2021</p><p>Details: <a href=#>https://t.co/JsIRTHxGP9</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xn5GbMDkCV</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=#>June 16, 2021</a></figure><p>If you're interested, you can check out the entire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post here</a> for further context, but it basically just boils down to the fact that they need to stop allocating resources to a quickly dwindling userbase.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nobody cares where’s GTA 6 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FPczmKmdjQ</a></p>— 𝕁𝕦𝕨𝕒𝕟 𝕒𝕜𝕒 𝕊𝕔𝕠𝕥𝕥 ℙ𝕚𝕝𝕘𝕣𝕚𝕞 (@rudeboyjemo) <a href=#>June 16, 2021</a></figure><p>There are some gamers who are probably up in arms about the fact that transferring their data over to another console isn't part of the discontinuation deal, but Rockstar made that move back in 2017. It's also important to note that you cannot buy a new Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 from a store. They were discontinued, and any console you'd purchase now would have to be second-hand.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I get that some people may be upset but you've had over a decade to save up 50-200 dollars and if you're in such a bad financial spot that it's not possible for you I feel for you but maybe look for another hobby.
