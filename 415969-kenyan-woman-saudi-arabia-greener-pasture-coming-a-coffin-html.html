She carried the kids and went with them. I did not follow up with her immediately,'' Njenga narrated.</i><p class=align-left>According to him, Esther had initially tried a hotel <a href=#>business</a> and selling tea leaves but she was very ambitious and wanted to give her children a better life, which was the reason she wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.</p><i>"When she left for Saudi Arabia, she was in her mother's hands. I was never told, I actually learnt that she left from my sister, when she was at the airport and wanted to talk to our son. Only her mother can explain how she left, who facilitated her flight,'' Bernard said.</i><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2c530d7f9bafaead_w.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Peninah Kyalo: My Husband Hasn't Touched Me for 23 Years, Gave Me Permission to See Other Men</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Follow TUKO.co.ke on Twitter</a>!</strong></p><h2>Her sister-in-law's account</h2><p class=align-left>The husband's sister Milka narrated that the two used to talk even when she travelled to Saudi Arabia and at one point she promised to pay her flight back to Kenya but she refused.</p><i>"On February 28, I messaged her because she had stayed for weeks without talking to anyone.
