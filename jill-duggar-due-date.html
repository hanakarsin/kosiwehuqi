Luckily, a number of them are incredibly active on social media — including <a href=#>Jill Duggar</a>, who announced she's pregnant with her third child with Derick Dillard. So when is she due?</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Jill's pregnancy announcement and her upcoming due date.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jill Duggar announced in February 2022 that she's pregnant with her third child.</h2><p>On Feb. 27, 2022, Jill took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to share a photo of herself, Derick, and their two sons, Israel and Samuel, alongside a teaser, "Exciting news!!"</p><p>They proceeded to share the big news on the Dillards' website. "We’ve been keeping a little secret!" they wrote. "Ever since we were devastated last fall by the miscarriage of our sweet baby, River Bliss, we have prayed that, if it was God’s will, he would bless us with another baby."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The announcement continued: "We are excited to announce that God has answered our prayers and we are expecting our rainbow baby ... We are so thankful for a healthy baby and pregnancy so far and we look forward to finding out the gender soon!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does she call it a rainbow baby? Jill previously suffered a miscarriage.</h2><p>A child born after a parent has previously suffered the death of an infant, a stillbirth, or a miscarriage is often referred to as a rainbow baby. The idea is that new life is "the rainbow after the storm."</p><p>In October 2021, Jill and Derick revealed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their family's website</a> — and with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> — that Jill had miscarried.</p><p>"We recently found out that we were expecting our third baby," they wrote. "We were all thrilled! It was fun to see so much joy in the boys' faces as we shared the news with them."</p><p>Jill and Derick explained that Israel and Samuel had so many questions about pregnancy and how they would help when the baby was born.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"However, a few days later we started miscarrying," the statement continued. "Even though it was too early to tell the baby's gender, we picked a name that we feel encompasses our baby's significance and the life we will always remember: River Bliss Dillard."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When is Jill Duggar's due date for baby No. 3?</h2><p>Jill's due date is in July 2022, per the pregnancy reveal. With that said, her baby could very well arrive a couple of weeks early or late — so depending on whether her due date is in early, middle, or late July, she could potentially give birth in June or August.</p><p>When Jill was pregnant with Israel and Samuel, she often posted bump photos sharing what week of pregnancy she was in. If she does so for baby No. 3, we could get a clearer idea of what her exact due date is in the coming months.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jill (Duggar) Dillard (@jillmdillard)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jill and Derrick posted gender reveal photos, and it's a ....</h2><p>On March 23, the expecting parents shared the sex of their third child via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their family's blog</a>."We had originally planned on finding out our baby’s gender earlier, a couple weeks ago, but COVID hit our family and we had to delay the exciting revelation," they explained. "However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because by the time we were able to reschedule, Israel was on spring break."</p><p>They continued: "This meant our whole family could be together for the appointment, as we all found out together that another little boy would be joining the Dillard tribe!"</p><p>Hopefully, Jill will share regular updates with her Instagram followers as her due date nears. We wish her a healthy pregnancy as she continues to keep up with her two boys and prepares for the arrival of baby No. 3!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7atuIydrKCfkad6pcHEZpuarJU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
