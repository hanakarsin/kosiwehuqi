Is Buhari doing enough about it? I don’t believe he is.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>Can he do enough about it? Of course he can", </i>the ex-president said. Obasanjo also maintained: <i>“All youths in Nigeria have legitimate reasons to feel frustrated and angry,” noting that some of those protesting “don’t even know what the struggle is all about, but if it gives them false hope, why not hang onto it?”</i></p><p class=align-left>Okogie, who added that the president’s first term report card would be a stumbling block for his quest for re-election, said those calling him out for another shot at the Presidency do not mean well for Buhari and the nation. They are simply enemies of Nigeria, he insisted.</p><p class=align-left>He said: <i>“As far as Cardinal Anthony Okogie is concerned, his first term is bad; I think it’s below the average mark.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“So, this will not give him a better chance to stand for a second term. From what is on ground, I don’t think he will get anywhere. The main thing that Nigerians want now is to see the dividends of democracy in action.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“They are telling us that we have pulled out of the recession. Go to the market, there’s nothing like that. There’s no sign of improvement. What is sold for N10 still sells for N10 or even at N12. Is that what you call improvement of the economy?</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“They promised to do everything but on getting into saddle, they keep procrastinating. Look at the state of the nation today. It’s as if there is no government.”</i> Okogie also lampooned the legislature, saying they are moving the country backwards.</p><p class=align-left><i>“Look at the parliament, what are they doing in the House of Representatives? What are they doing in the Senate? What are the so-called big men doing? It’s very painful. We are going from bad to worse. Very soon, we’ll get to worst if there’s no change before December.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Everybody is taking the laws into their hands the way they like. Would you call this a nation? You can’t walk freely on the street. You are not sure of having a meal per day. You are not sure of seeing tomorrow.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“People are not asleep. People are opening their eyes every day to see what these people are doing. And that is why they are struggling to have their man at the top. There are many other people lined up. And we’re talking about Buhari and Atiku.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"Can they even win the primaries? These noisemakers are just making people to know that they are alive,”</i> he said.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Install our latest app for Android, read best news on Nigeria’s #1 news app</p><p class=align-left>Also speaking, Bishop Steven Ogedengbe, presiding bishop of Evangelical Ministries (a.k.a Wisdom Chapel), Akowonjo, Egbeda, Lagos, said that those who love the president should preoccupy themselves with prayers for God to help him finish the first term.
