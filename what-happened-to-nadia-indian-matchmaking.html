She was a fan favorite during Season 1, but a lot of opinions about her changed during Season 2.</p><p>The reason is that she got caught up in a messy love triangle. At first, Nadia seemed happy to be involved with Shekhar. He visited with her family and they had a lot of things in common to talk about. But her interest in him suddenly shifted when she met Vishal.</p><p>Nadia's instant connection with Vishal led her to believe that there was nothing left to pursue with Shekhar.</p><p><a href=#>Sima Taparia</a> is the matchmaking expert who leads the way on Indian Matchmaking. From her perspective, Nadia's romance with Vishal was doomed from the beginning. She didn‚Äôt approve of it due to the fact that Vishal was seven years younger than Nadia. Regardless of Sima‚Äôs disapproval, Nadia decided to press on with Vishal anyway.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nadia Jagessarüá¨üáæ (@nadiajagessar)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@nadiajagessar</a></figure><p>She cut things off with Shekhar via FaceTime in order to continue pursuing a relationship with Vishal. Unfortunately for her, Vishal dumped her just a few short episodes later. Although things didn‚Äôt work out for Nadia romantically during the show, she‚Äôs done her best to make light of the situation.</p><p>On May 31, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia posted a funny video</a> on Instagram with an on-screen text block that said, ‚ÄúLooking for a husband who can cook because I literally just burned toast." She mentioned that she was looking for serious inquiries only in the caption but added enough playful hashtags to prove she was showing off her sense of humor.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/@Netflix</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here‚Äôs what Nadia has said about love outside of the show.</h2><p>Nadia spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brides Today</a> about love, relationships, and what she hopes to experience in the future. When the publication told her she came across as a confidently independent woman who prefers living life on her own terms, her advice to other women was incredibly clear.</p><p>She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always easy because people may not be comfortable with your decisions or your opinions. I do want a family of my own, but I also know that will happen when it‚Äôs right for me. I tried to live my best life each day because you can‚Äôt make everyone else happy, but you can control your own happiness.‚Äù</p><p>Having a husband and children is still important to Nadia, even though it hasn‚Äôt happened in her life just yet.</p><p>Indian Matchmaking Seasons 1 and 2 are available for streaming on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSnmZSerm61zZ2gmqZdoq61r8emmKShnpw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
