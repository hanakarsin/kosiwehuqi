Iginla stressed that Nigeria does not belong to a set of religions, and urged political big wigs in the country to save the country from the unforeseen.</p><p>The cleric said: “I asked myself, in a country like Nigeria with too much strong religious beliefs, why will the ruling party go for a Muslim-Muslim ticket? Why will their presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, go with that view? I asked myself again if we don’t know, we are sounding the drum of war in a place where there is unity, peace, and understanding despite our differences.</p><p>“Nigeria is a country for all and does not belong to a particular set of religions. It has never happened before in this country. Why now?</p><p>“If we must make Nigeria great, we must allow equity, justice and sensitivity to be the watch of the day for our leaders. I am pleading in my heart; this was not the Nigeria I was born to. This was not the Nigeria that our great heroes fought for. What is going on? Our leaders, please save us because the Muslim-Muslim ticket is a sign of war”.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Tinubu a few days ago, picked Borno State Senator, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kashim Shettima</strong> </a>as his running mate for the 2023 election.</p><p>The former Governor of Lagos who is known as a Muslim from the Southern part of the country picked Shettima, a devoted Muslim from the north.</p><p>Tinubu’s choice has since generated reactions and calls for a rethink by Nigerians who had clamoured for a Christian running mate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BxZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6wzqerZqicqruosYytn55lk6TCr8DRsmSipqSkerit0Wanq6egnbK1ecigoKekkWLBprjLrGStoZ6qr7Z5wKmaaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
