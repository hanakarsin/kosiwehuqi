It is especially the case because of the divergence of views regarding Snowden. Some think he is a traitor while others heap praises on him as a hero. To the government, however, he is a criminal and is still wanted for the theft of government property. Given that, Snowden is said to be staying in Russia where he was given asylum after fleeing from the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8e665a69a916ad82.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Adam Johnson's wife, Dr Suzanne Johnson?
