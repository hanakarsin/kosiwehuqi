In an interview with E!'s Nightly Pop, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot New Hip Hop</a>, Saweetie spent May 2021 waving off dating rumors. "What is my love life like? It's the pillows, the studio, and putting more money into my bank account," the songstress proclaimed.</p><p>Saweetie also offered some sage words of wisdom to her female listeners, adding, "This is for all my women out there. I just feel like, after a relationship, relationships take up a lot of time. So, right now, I'm just getting back to self because perfecting my craft is my No. 1 priority and if, you know, if Cupid finds me and shoots me, then shoot me, baby."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>However, fans believe that Saweetie may be back in the dating pool once again.</p><p>On Nov. 28, Instagram sleuths questioned Saweetie's relationship status after she shared an Instagram picture of herself sitting on an unidentified man's lap.

And over the weekend, photos of the two hit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all of the social media blogs</a>.</p><p>While fans were convinced that Saweetie may be secretly romancing "The Box" MC, she quickly shut the rumors down.

A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet posted June 7, 2021</a>, reads, "Now why TF are people saying Saweetie and James Harden fw each other..." Offset liked the tweet, sparking fan speculation everywhere. Some took this as confirmation that Saweetie was with the professional athlete.</p><p>Others were more skeptical of the couple, as neither party had even remotely confirmed their relationship.
