I didn’t want to stand and keep expecting people to call me for shows. At that time one even had to beg to be allowed to perform on stage even though your song was been played.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>I decided to be a conductor because I didn’t want to be idle. I was a conductor for almost a decade. I used to ply Agege-Ikeja-Maryland-Yaba. I shuttled that route for three to four years then I moved to Oshodi-Mushin under bridge.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>I also used to ride okada during this period; I’ve also done the needful to my former bus driver. One thing I’ve learnt is if you fail to plan, you will plan to fail. If you don’t program yourself, life will program you. I also used to go to school during this period. That was how I finished.
