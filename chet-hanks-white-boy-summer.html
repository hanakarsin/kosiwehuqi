The second-oldest son of <a href=#>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson</a>, known for his&nbsp;controversial comments, is back on Instagram telling us all about his ideas for how summer 2021 will go.&nbsp;</p><p>While many are hesitant to feel optimistic about the summer due to the coronavirus pandemic still raging, Chet thinks it will be "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White Boy Summer</a>." Here's everything you need to know about what that means.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's what Chet Hanks said about "White Boy Summer."</h2><p>In an Instagram post on Mar. 26. 2021, Chet posted a video with the caption, "It's it bout to be a #WhiteboySummer or am I trippin ???? Tag a REAL vanilla king #Respectfully." The actual content of the video was far more interesting, with Chet clarifying what kind of "white boy summer" he was talking about.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chet explained, "Okay guys, look I just wanted to tap in really quick. I just got this feeling, man, that this summer is about to be a white boy summer, you know? Take it how you want. I’m not talking about Trump, you know, NASCAR type white. I’m talking about me, Jon B, Jack Harlow type white boy summer. Let me know if you guys can vibe with that and get ready, because I am."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The other person Chet mentions in his video is&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Harlow</a>, a young rapper who is best known for his hit single "What's Poppin'." Jack has been lauded as a "woke" white man who showcases his exuberant personality on Twitter. Chet's clarification about Trump and NASCAR seems like he's just trying to encourage a more wholesome version of "boys will be boys," which might not be a bad thing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twitter has a lot of feelings about Chet's "white boy summer" declaration.</h2><p>Like with most viral content, Twitter had a lot to say about Chet's remarks, which also take their key phrase from the iconic Meg Thee Stallion's <a href=#>"Hot Girl Summer" phrase of 2020</a>.</p><p>"Someone tell Chet Hanks we're already several thousand years into a white boy summer," one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">person quipped</a>, while another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said simply</a>, "I physically can not imagine Chet Hanks and Tom Hanks talking to each other."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chet Hanks proves that you can have the most wonderful parents ever & still become an asshole with this bs "White Boy Summer" comment.</p><p>Is there actual DNA evidence that he is their biological son?

In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a> he explained some of the rules, and they are revealing.&nbsp;</p><p>"Rule number 1, to all my white boys out there, no plaid shirts ... Rule number 2, no Sperry topsiders. That's not the type of white boys we're talking about dawg! ... No calling girls 'smoke shows' okay? That term, it's played out dude."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chet also noted he would be back with more rules and regulations, but in an Instagram post on the same day, he claimed that more about "white boy summer" would be revealed as long as you subscribed to his new acting program, called "Actor's Advantage." We have to wonder: Is this all a highly in-depth marketing ploy?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe Chet, a known Soundcloud rapper, could be teasing new music? After all, Meg's "Hot Girl Summer" also manifested rapper Blackbear's "hot girl bummer," so anything is possible.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWmwIyhmKejo2LEqbXTnmSbp6liwLa5zJ6p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
