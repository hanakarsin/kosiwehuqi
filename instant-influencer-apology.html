The beauty YouTuber and makeup artist boasts 19 million followers.</p><p>About to celebrate the big 2-1, James is already a multimillionaire and Cover Girl’s first-ever male brand ambassador.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But ‘Instant Influencer’ is in trouble for the apology episode.</h2><p>Yes, you read that right — it's possible to get in trouble for apologizing. James gets a lot of things right, according to his fans — one of which is owning up to his mistakes in the form of public video apologies.</p><p>Great, right? Yes! But now, in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Season 1, Episode 3</u></a> of his current competition challenge, he’s teaching contestants — along with fellow YouTubers — how to create apology videos of their own.</p><p>The episode is called “I have to apologize for this…” and it already has 12.7 million views and counting. And to many, this is coming off as insincere, as are any of the public apologies he has issued in the past using the techniques he introduces on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He says apologies are part of influencer life.</h2><p>James opens the episode by scolding the contestants for “what they did last week,” without saying what it was, and saying that they owe him an apology. The group is confused and concerned, until James tells them he’s just kidding.</p><p>From there, he segues into the episode’s apology challenge.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Uh oh 😳 What’s going to happen on tomorrow’s episode of #instantinfluencer?</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Instant Influencer</a> (@instantinfluencer) on May 7, 2020 at 12:00pm PDT</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>“Take this from me because I've had to deal with this,” James says in the episode. “As an influencer, when you grow a following, you will either say or do something that people might not like and might not agree with, and eventually, you might have to apologize.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here are James’ top tips for apologizing.</h2><p>The advice James has for his contestants is to address the issue ASAP, ditch the makeup, and make sure that your expression is somber.&nbsp;</p><p>Not surprisingly, this is the technique he uses in his own apology videos. The most famous was an emotional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>eight-minute video</u></a> to fellow beauty YouTuber Tati and her husband, James Westbrook, for his half of their ongoing drama.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Social media is going nuts on the subject.</h2><p>As expected, there’s the “how could he” camp and, in the opposing corner, the “chill out” gang. As they battle it out, the enraged group is really, really angry, pointing out how it highlights the disingenuous nature of James and other influencers in general.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Controversial opinion here: I absolutely HATED the apology compact challenge on Instant Influencer.
