Although these rules are slightly loosened in places across the U.S., most restaurants still expect you to order at least two meats. This would be, in effect, the same as having another person with you."</p><p>The restaurant Sunshine visited was BWON Shabu & BBQ in Fullerton, Calif.. The TikToker wrote in a caption for the video: "When the restaurant doesn‚Äôt let you dine in because you‚Äôre a party of 1. And you‚Äôre told next time bring a friend maybe I‚Äôm just hungry and emotional but I definitely cried in my car :("</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@sunshine_inthekitchen href=#>@sunshine_inthekitchen</a><p>When the restaurant doesn‚Äôt let you dine in because you‚Äôre a party of 1.

No, the problem comes from what other people might think. Those who have solomangarephobia think people feel like only sad, friendless people, those who got stood up, eat alone at the restaurant. Basically the losers, those who are stigmatized."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sunshine_inthekitchen</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spoon University</a> featured an article written by a self-proclaimed solomangarephobic who says it's not the act of eating alone that worries them. Their anxiety is rooted in the belief they will face social stigma for doing so; that others will be looking at them and judging that they don't have anyone to join them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sunshine_inthekitchen</span></figure><p>The outlet writes: "Believe it or not, your fear of eating alone is quite legitimate," and offered some helpful tips to deal with their anxiety while dining alone in public. They caution against simply being "glued" to your smartphone, but to instead try to look around and observe your surroundings.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sunshine_inthekitchen</span></figure><p>Some studies stress the importance of alone time for one's own mental development. If you find yourself alone during a meal without distraction or external stimulation, you're flexing your brain's muscles to better entertain and engage yourself.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sunshine_inthekitchen</span></figure><p>Even though a lot's been written to help folks cope with their anxieties in eating out alone, there were still many TikToker users who related to Sunshine's post and expressed sympathy with her solo-dining plight.</p><p>"I‚Äôd literally cry lol," said one.</p><p>"As someone who loves eating out alone, this is a new fear unlocked lol," said another.</p><p>"I‚Äôm so sorry!! As if going to a restaurant alone isn‚Äôt hard enough," a third commenter wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @sunshine_inthekitchen</span></figure><p>Others couldn't understand the two-person-minimum policy, while some thought this was common knowledge when it comes to dining at Korean BBQ establishments.</p><p>Have you ever heard of a restaurant requiring a two person minimum?
