Additionally, the beloved TV show often features appearances from various other family members.</p><p>Among these relatives are Danielle's twin sisters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Mowbray</a> (Aunt LiLi) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal Mills</a> (Aunt KiKi). We know quite a bit about Ashley — she owns <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heist Hair Bar</a> and is the board secretary for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anchor Point</a> — but what about Crystal?</p><p>Here's everything we know about Aunt KiKi!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @cmills2007</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Aunt KiKi from 'OutDaughtered'?</h2><p>Crystal Mills was born on November 13, 1982, and hails from League City, Texas. She has carved out a notable presence in the reality TV world, rising to fame on OutDaughtered, where she lovingly assumes the role of Aunt KiKi to her six nieces.</p><p>Aunt KiKi is depicted as an integral part of her nieces' lives, showcasing the tight bond she shares with them. Off-screen, Crystal is a devoted wife to Dale Mills (who just so happens to be her co-host on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Happily Ever Banter</a> podcast) and a proud mom to their two kids, Bronson and Mackenzie.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Crystal Mills “Aunt KiKi” (@cmills2007)</a></p></figure><p>In 2019, Crystal and her sisters co-founded the company CADi Fitness. However, on Jan. 18, 2023, Danielle took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce they were shutting the business down.</p><p>"Hey, y'all! CADi Girls have some Big News to share. With heavy hearts, these CADi sisters have decided it is time to say farewell to CADi Fitness," she wrote. "We've had to realign & prioritize our personal & business responsibilities, and ultimately, we don't have the capacity to focus on maintaining and growing CADi Fitness at this time in our lives.</p><p>Danielle added, "To our CADi Girls, you have meant the world to us. We are truly grateful for your love and support over the past three and half years."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Aunt KiKi said babysitting the quintuplets is "total chaos."</h2><p>In the May 28, 2024, episode of OutDaughtered, Aunt KiKi is on babysitting duty — but things quickly take a chaotic turn. The quintuplets express their displeasure with Aunt KiKi when she forgets to pick them up at the bus stop, leaving them to trek home on foot.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adam Busby (@adambuzz)</a></p><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>"KiKi should be fired because she forgot us girls," Riley says in a confessional with her sisters. Adding to the frustration, Parker notes, "And she also says bad words."</p><p>As Aunt KiKi attempts to get the girls ready for an event at Danielle's workplace, several challenges mount. While delegating tasks, including sending Riley to get "nice clothes" from the laundry, KiKi realizes she "totally forgot I had to put the clothes from the washer into the dryer, I mean it just totally slipped my mind."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Crystal Mills “Aunt KiKi” (@cmills2007)</a></p><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>Plus, the girls' resistance complicates matters further. When instructed to wear dresses, they voice their objections.</p><p>"I hate dresses," Hazel declares, as she and Olivia enjoy Oreos and milk. To make matters worse, Aunt KiKi then mistakenly identifies Olivia as her twin, Ava, escalating the situation into utter chaos.</p><p>"It has been a hectic day. We had no time, and then it was just one thing after another. It's crazy," Aunt KiKi says in a confessional. "It's just so overwhelming. I mean, it's total chaos."</p><p>Catch new episodes of OutDaughtered on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJqtnql6rLXKomSoraSZrrazx62cq52U</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
