Her distaste for romantic relationships — according to The Cut, she finds them oppressive — and her progressive parenting style made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RHONY</a> fans like her all the more.&nbsp;So, what's Leah's family life like? What should we know about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">daughter</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet KiKi, Leah McSweeney's 12-year-old daughter.</h2><p>Kier Marie (Kiki) is Leah's only daughter.&nbsp;According to a legendary tale the star shared in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Observer,</a> Kiki was conceived during the 2006 New York Fashion Week.&nbsp;</p><p>The event marked new beginnings in Leah's private and professional life alike. It was the first time she and then-boyfriend Rob Cristofaro had the chance to present their latest venture, Married to the Mob, and it also marked a new chapter for them as a family.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Leah founded Married to the Mob with the $75,000 worth of compensation she received after a run-in with the NYPD. Upon leaving a concert at Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom, the police ushered away Leah's date without an explanation.&nbsp;</p><p>Overcome with anger, she threw a bottle in the police officer's direction, semi-accidentally hitting him on his back. In response, the policeman punched her, slamming her face against the subway gates. She lost a tooth.&nbsp;</p><p>She took NYPD to court, and a few years later, she was compensated with enough money to start a fashion brand.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Big Gyal Tings</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Leah McSweeney</a> (@leahmob) on Dec 25, 2017 at 7:51pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 12 years, Leah managed to turn the small but ambitious project into a prominent label. She made collaborations with Wu-Tang and ILoveMakonnen, and blue-chip companies like Reebok, Nike, and Lacoste. However, none of this does she seem to be as proud of as she is her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiki features in some of Leah's wildest anecdotes.&nbsp;In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, the RHONY star revealed that she could never muster the courage to divulge her brief encounter with the police to her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident marked her first foray into the world of stardom — which was covered by outlets like The Daily Mail, Radar Online, and Time — but she couldn't bring herself to talk about it with her daughter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Take us back to Ginger Hill</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Leah McSweeney</a> (@leahmob) on May 17, 2018 at 8:11pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The strange experience remained a tightly locked secret for a good few years. That is, until Kiki came across her mother's mugshot on Google Image Search while preparing for a school project. As to her response? As Leah told the outlet, Kiki received the news with the nonchalance of a true New Yorker.&nbsp;</p><p>"I guess for a school project she needed a photo of me, and she Googled me, which I should have told her never to do that. And she was basically like, 'Mom, why do you have a mugshot?'" Leah told People.&nbsp;</p><p>“She doesn’t think anything of it [...] She’s like her mom, in that sense. Not much phases us New Yorkers," she added.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobKitIymmqyvlZq7psWMnZiun5ipsrN50aGmp7E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
