However, he also stated that if his advice is ignored that he will board the faulty vehicle with the burden off his shoulder in case the inevitable happens.”</p><p>Kalu added that Governor Ikpeazu believes that restructuring PDP would give them in the South East the room to discuss with their people what is in it for them in a potential PDP federal government.</p><p>He noted, “As someone who has worked closely with Governor Ikpeazu, I can easily say that Tinubu and APC will not even be second or third choice for him if he actually feels greatly discontented with his party, the PDP. Leave Governor Ikpeazu out of your speculations and continue to vote for PDP.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49wZmtoYmh6sbDPZqafnpmYtqK4jKynnpmbqHqwuoyioqmdka%2FCbsPOq6Kippdis7C%2BjK2gp62SqsBuvNGeqqKclaOwuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
