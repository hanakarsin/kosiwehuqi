Is Jed still looking for love and a recording contract?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Jed Wyatt now?</h2><p>After his entire fanbase seemingly turned against him following the revelation that he was in a relationship with another woman while filming The Bachelorette, Jed took a mini hiatus from social media, eventually breaking his silence just one week after the live finale aired in July.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Since then, the 26-year-old has been updating his page regularly, and introduced Instagram followers to his new girlfriend, <a href=#>Ellen Decker</a>, in November. Jed appears to be completely smitten with the personal trainer/model.</p><p>In the pair’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first post</a> together, the songwriter thanked a friend for "introducing me to the only person to make me smile more than riding a [jet ski]." On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his birthday</a> in January, Jed wrote, "I can’t thank God enough for putting you in my life, Ellen. You are the true definition of a beautiful soul, inside and out."</p><p>The duo recently celebrated their five-month anniversary in quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic. "I love you, El. Wouldn’t want to be cooped up with anyone else," Jed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned a pic</a> on Instagram. "You are THE puzzle queen and the missing piece to mine."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Jed on 'The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart'?</h2><p>Sadly, we won’t be seeing the country artist attempting to advance his career on the series, but his new song, "45’n," drops on April 17. The release comes three months after the debut of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his last single</a>, "Risk," which did not get high marks from fans. "He’s actually terrible," one individual commented on social media, while another added, "This is painful to listen to."</p><p>In an interview promoting Listen to Your Heart, everyone’s favorite host, Chris Harrison, couldn’t help but shade the former reality star and his "talent." "No offense to Jed, but these are legitimate musicians from all across the spectrum," the TV personality told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have people that came from their church choirs, people that have a Broadway background, people who have been grinding in Nashville for years and have never made it," he added. "We have one of the guys who made it pretty far on American Idol."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Still, Chris admitted, Jed’s lackluster vocal ability isn’t the problem. "This may have been the perfect show for him, although again, he still could not have come on with a girlfriend," the 48-year-old noted. "That's the whole point. You need to be single. I guess that would have been a big hurdle to get over."</p><p>As for the 23 contestants we will be meeting on Listen to Your Heart, Chris hinted that they could show up on other spin-offs in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>"Just having met all of these people and watching them evolve, I could easily see some of them ending up on the beach in Paradise or maybe it doesn’t work out and they end up coming onto The Bachelor or Bachelorette," he shared.</p><p>New episodes of The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart air Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlmpqxbsPYmqutZZ6kxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
