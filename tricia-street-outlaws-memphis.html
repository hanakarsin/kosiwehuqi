Though they grew up in the same 700-person town outside of Memphis, they didn’t become a couple until JJ was in his 30s — and a father of seven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Naturally, he was the one who introduced her to street racing. "[JJ] asked me one day if I wanted to try it," Tricia recalled. "I raced and it’s been a journey ever since."</p><p>"At first, she tore up a lot of stuff and cost us a lot of money," JJ admitted. But in the end, none of that really mattered. "I love Trish. I feel like she saved me and my life," he continued. "She brought a lot of happiness to my life. She got me on the right path." Tricia added, "We go together like a hand and a glove."</p><p>The duo went on to have four children: three daughters and one son. "We don’t script anything, you know?" JJ said of their TV series. "I don’t race for a living. I race because I love it and it’s something I believe in."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">JJ and Tricia’s net worth isn’t as high as you might think.</h2><p>As the 46-year-old said, he isn’t in it for the money — which is why you won’t see him racing around a professional track. "Me, personally, and my family, we’re not millionaires, and we could never buy the kind of things it takes to go to a track and run that crazy-fast time," JJ explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragzine</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He also wouldn’t dream of abandoning his crew, even if it meant a bigger payday. "No amount of money could hire me to go and be with another group or another city," JJ shared. "I’d rather stay in Memphis if I didn’t get paid a dollar. Just to do it for the love."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tricia is longtime friends with fellow female racer Precious Cooper.</h2><p>The ladies, along with JJ, have been pals since childhood, and Precious is even the godmother of Tricia’s children. "In our town, everybody street races," JJ told Monsters & Critics. "It’s what we done on Sundays… After you get out of church, go to the spot and everybody’s out there street racing."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for JJ and Precious, the pair has and always will be strictly platonic. "She helps take care of all of my bills. She helps me as much as I help her. It’s just kind of a neutral respect," he stated. "Nothing crazy."</p><p>When speaking about his entire team, JJ emphasized, "We’re not family by blood. We’re family by choice."</p><p>Watch new episodes of Street Outlaws: Memphis Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on Discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2Bqr8iaZKysopqytXnOrqulmaeoeq6xzKmfoqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
