However, in January 2024, the “Paint The Town Red” artist made headlines for something regarding her family.</p><p>On Jan. 12, TMZ obtained a document from the Los Angeles Superior Court showing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">temporary restraining order</a> filed by Doja’s mother, Debra Elizabeth Sawyer, against the singer’s <a href=#>brother, Raman Dalithando Dlamini</a>.</p><p>The order accused Raman of being physically violent towards Debra and Doja and allegedly inflicting cuts and bruises on her body, knocking out Doja’s teeth, and stealing the Grammy winner’s belongings.</p><p>Doja, whose birth name is Amala Ratna Zadile Dlamini, has yet to comment. However, the “Woman” artist has shared details about her other siblings. Keep reading to see what she’s expressed about her family’s history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Doja Cat has said she feels “blessed” to have her siblings in her life.</h2><p>Doja, born in 1995, didn’t have a traditional nuclear family growing up. Her mother, Debra, raised her and her brother, Raman, in Los Angeles, Calif. Doja shared in a September 2019 issue of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fader</a> that her mom was a single mother and took care of the siblings primarily by herself.</p><p>According to multiple reports, Doja’s father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dumisani Dlamini</a>, an actor who starred in the movie Sarafina alongside <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>, was only married to her mother for a few months. Following their divorce, he had several other children from other relationships.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Doja cat's brother is ugly 🤮🤮! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SqBogyIdUW</a></p>— Fendi Minaj 🩷.

And while she wishes she could’ve lived with her other siblings, the singer told Fader she’s “blessed” to have a relationship with them, even if it doesn’t look normal to the rest of the world.</p><p>“It’s always great to have both of your parents in your life and all of your brothers and sisters, and everybody loves each other,” Doja said. “But, like, s--t isn’t like that sometimes.”</p><p>Doja seems to be the only one of her siblings who decided to join her in the entertainment industry. She also doesn’t show her siblings often, but a photo of her and her brother circulated on several outlets amid Doja’s mother's assault allegations against her brother.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Doja Cat has never met her father, Dumisani Dlamini, in person.</h2><p>Doja’s alleged violent relationship with her brother isn’t the only familial drama in her life. Although Doja’s father, Dumisani, connects with his daughter on Instagram, the two have never met in real life.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Doja and Dumisani have lived on separate continents for most of Doja’s life, with her in the U.S. and him residing in South Africa. Due to her father living overseas, Doja couldn’t see her father at her leisure, something she said she admits has been challenging for her as an adult.</p><p>“I felt confused a little bit,” Doja told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> of her father’s absence in 2021. “It’s a little strange to see everybody else with their dad, and you didn’t even really have one.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dumisani (@official_dumisanidlamini)</a></p></figure><p>Doja also discussed her relationship with her father and Fader in 2019. The singer shared that, despite Dumisani not being active in her childhood, she has no animosity towards her father.</p><p>“I don’t hold grudges against him or anything in any way, but obviously, it’s a little weird,” she explained to the outlet.</p><p>Dumisani, for his part, has nothing but kind words for his daughter. In 2023, the actor shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ South Africa</a> that he’s “proud of her for what she has achieved” and isn’t surprised by his daughter’s achievements because “it’s in the blood.”</p><p>We hope Doja takes time to care for herself amid her sibling and parental drama!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyrrYycmK1lo56vrbXNoKo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
