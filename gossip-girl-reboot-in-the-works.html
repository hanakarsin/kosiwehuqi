Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley, Chace Crawford and Ed Westwick starred in the original Gossip Girl. While we can't imagine a more iconic Blair Waldorf than Leighton, it's unclear whether the crew will return.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leighton told E! News</a> in early 2019, "No one's ever asked me. No one's ever talked to me about it except for in interviews and I always say the same: I never say never, so I don't know. No one's sent me that information, it's coming from you."</p><p><br></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>don't revive gossip girl if we don't get to see leighton meester as blair waldorf because whats the point</p>‚Äî ùîûùî™ùîüùî¢ùîØ (@saintvenchy) <a href=#>July 17, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When we found out <a href=#>#GossipGirl</a> was starting again vs When we found out it‚Äôs not the original cast...üò∞ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vH57KiC0ge</a></p>‚Äî PrettyLittleThing (@OfficialPLT) <a href=#>July 17, 2019</a></figure><p>In fact, the new take on Gossip Girl seems more like a totally new story, versus a true remake. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter reached out to Joshua Safran</a> to ask about whether or not the original characters would be coming back, but the EP declined to comment. According to THR, he sees the reboot as an "extension" of the original series. The new Gossip Girl's logline states: "Eight years after the original website went dark, a new generation of New York private school teens are introduced to the social surveillance of Gossip Girl. The prestige series will address just how much social media ‚Äî and the landscape of New York itself ‚Äî has changed in the intervening years." No Blair? No Serena? No creepy Dan? Who will be Gossip Girl?<br></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Eugene Gologursky/WireImage</span></figure><p>Joshua states, "It's just a new look at this particular society in New York, the idea being that society changes constantly. So how has this world changed, how has social media and its effect changed? All of those things allow us to look at the world 12 years on as opposed to just redoing the story. None of us are interested in just redoing a story."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When will the Gossip Girl reboot air?</h2><p>According to THR, HBO Max is scheduled to launch in spring 2020. The streaming platform will come with over 10,000 hours of content, including Friends (yup, that's why the show is leaving Netflix), Game of Thrones, Pretty Little Liars, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and more. Along with the new Gossip Girl, HBO Max is bringing more new originals on board, including Dune: The Sisterhood, Tokyo Vice, a Big Bang Theory spinoff with Kaley Cuoco called The Flight Attendant, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While we don't have an exact date yet, it sounds like HBO Max has a ton of original shows launching in spring 2020, and Gossip Girl 2.0 will most likely be one of them.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How did Gossip Girl end? Who was Gossip Girl?</h2><p>If you haven't watched the original series, or need a reminder: Gossip Girl ended with Blair and Chuck getting married and having a kid, Dan "Lonely Boy" Humphrey was revealed to be Gossip Girl (gasp!), Serena and Dan also end up getting married even though Dan was a creep the entire time, and Nate is running for New York City mayor (LOL).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>Stay tuned for more Gossip Girl updates.
