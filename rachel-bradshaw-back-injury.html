Terry is considered a football legend, and the E! show follows the silly adventures he embarks on with his blended family.</p><p>Between Terry and his wife Tammy, they have three daughters. But the show also includes several storylines with their extended family members and close friends. The NFL icon provides viewers with a glimpse into what life is like at home far beyond the privilege his family has. The show also sheds light on plenty of their heartbreaking situations and struggles. One of those struggles revolves around Terry’s daughter <a href=#>Rachel Bradshaw</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What’s the story with Rachel Bradshaw‘s back injury?</h2><p>Throughout Rachel‘s life, she’s been dealing with a long and super complex battle with scoliosis — a sideways curvature of the spine.</p><p>Rachel has been open about her diagnosis, and in 2018, she revealed that she'd had surgery three years prior to try to correct her spine issues. She wrote, “Cannot believe it’s been three years since I’ve had my scoliosis surgery! I was born with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) and had it checked out when I was 28. The doctor ordered me to get immediate surgery due to the damage it can do to your body."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RACHEL BRADSHAW (@racheltbradshaw)</a></p></figure><p>Her comment section was filled with several messages of support and encouragement from her fans.</p><p>Rachel hasn’t let issues with her back get in the way of living a fulfilling life.

Just three months after their wedding day, he was tragically killed in a single-car crash right next to their home.
