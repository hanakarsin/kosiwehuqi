Turns out there's a massive storm hitting Canada, and Drake's gigantic abode has flooded. The video is something to behold!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Drake's Toronto home flooded with water during a massive storm.</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a> posted on July 16, Drake appears to take a POV video of himself walking through the halls of his giant house. There are several inches of water on the floor and some poor guy is standing at the doors of the room, futilely trying to keep them shut as water floods in.</p><p>The text overlay reads, "This better be Espresso Martini." To be fair, it doesn't look like the cleanest water. But hey! At least Drake has a sense of humor about it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@champagnepapi</span></figure><p>Turns out, there's a huge storm hitting the eastern side of Canada and the U.S., including, of course, Toronto. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weather Network</a>, "The next couple of days will feature thunderstorm risks across parts of Atlantic Canada, some which could turn severe in nature, with heavy rain, strong winds, and large hail all of concern."</p><p>If you happened the see the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a> feature about the rapper's "manor house," you know just how opulent it is. It does seem like a few inches of water would ruin the overall vibe.</p><p>We are quite certain that right now, Drake is thankful for the whole concept of homeowner's insurance. Here's hoping that Drake and the weather stop beefing soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb%2Bit8Rmn6ito5p6p7jOqJs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
