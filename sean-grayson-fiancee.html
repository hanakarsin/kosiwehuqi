We do know he is engaged to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabel Butterfield</a>, who is reportedly a nurse practitioner in Springfield, Ill. Grayson and Butterfield's wedding is set for Oct. 19, 2024, per their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Knot</a> wedding registry. There's no information on when the couple began dating or when they became engaged. However, his fiancée is reportedly tied to the department he worked at when he responded to Massey's 911 call.</p><p>A December 2020 post from the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office shows photos of Isabel with retired Sangamon chief deputy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Butterfield</a>. In the photos, Butterfield smiles next to two other women who appear to be his wife and daughter as he celebrates his retirement.</p><p>Multiple reports claim that Scott is Isabel's father and Grayson was hired into the department. However, there is no concrete evidence that Grayson's connection to the Butterfields had anything to do with his job.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>After Grayson was fired from his position as deputy sheriff, body cam footage of him allegedly killing Massey surfaced. The footage showed him asking Massey how she was doing "mentally," to which she replied she had taken her medicine that day.</p><p>The question led to reports Massey and Grayson may have known each other through his fiancée before he came to her house, though their connection hasn't been confirmed.</p><p>Neither Isabel Butterfield nor her family has publicly acknowledged Massey's shootings or Grayson's ongoing charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKiuoygqZqxo6S7brLImqWcnZU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
