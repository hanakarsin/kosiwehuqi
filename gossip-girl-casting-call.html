Fans have been asking for years for more of the hit CW show <a href=#>Gossip Girl,</a> and now it's finally being delivered. Well, kind of.</p><p>The spinoff was finally announced, and it's currently set to air sometime in 2020. None of the original cast is returning, which means that there's a chance to meet some <a href=#>new faces</a> for the series. Many have been on the lookout for casting calls to see if they have a chance at becoming the next Blake Lively circa the Upper West Side.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here are the details about the Gossip Girl casting calls.</h2><p>There's no confirmation as to who will be featured in this new cast. Or the plot. Or anything, really, revealing who might be slated to make an appearance. It's been rumored that the OG stars of Gossip Girl might be making some guest appearances, and Kristen Bell is slated to return as the gossip girl. But there aren't any solid characters revealed yet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gossip Girl (@gossipgirlfeed)</a> on Mar 22, 2019 at 11:55pm PDT</p></figure><p>All we have to go off of is the logline for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"Eight years after the original website went dark, a new generation of New York private school teens are introduced to the social surveillance of Gossip Girl. The prestige series will address just how much social media—and the landscape of New York itself—has changed in the intervening years," the logline reads. This time around, we'll be getting a whole new round of teens trying to navigate the New York City lifestyle.</p><p>If you're hoping to be cast in the upcoming series, it looks like they'll be looking for actors and actresses who can pass as young adults. There haven't been any official casting calls put out yet, which means the casting crew is likely being selective about who reads for the parts they have planned.</p><p>Since the original Gossip Girl did so well, and the reboot is sure to gain a huge audience, they're probably scoping out their more-established pool before opening it to the general public.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gossip Girl (@gossipgirlfeed)</a> on Nov 3, 2018 at 12:07pm PDT</p></figure><p>Looks like if you have any hope of making an appearance in the reboot, you should look for calls for extras. Since the series takes place on the Upper West Side, keep an eye out for postings about extras in the area if you want a shot.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The series is being produced by the original creators of Gossip Girl.&nbsp;</h2><p>Of course, to keep the show as true to the original series as possible, they're keeping some of the old crew on board. Joshua Safran, Josh Schwartz, and Stephanie Savage were the original executive producers for the show and will be returning to executive produce the reboot. Leslie Morgenstein and Gina Girolamo are also expected to join the production team.</p><p>Currently, the reboot is only slated for a 10-episode reimagining, but its performance will likely determine the longevity of the show. When it premieres in 2020, you'll be able to watch it just like you watched the original: only on the CW.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLy0v8ipZKChoqF6pK3SraCnn12Yrq24</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
