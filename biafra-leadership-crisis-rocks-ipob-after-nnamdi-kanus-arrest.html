Whatever anybody sows shall he reap.</p><p>“They shall be alive to experience the same pains they inflicted on those vulnerable who are unable to speak for themselves.</p><p>“The forces of heaven and earth shall continue to work in dissonance and in discordant pattern for all of you. Time shall definitely tell.”</p><p>Reacting to reports on a crack in IPOB, Emma Powerful told <strong>DailyPost</strong>&nbsp;that there is no crisis within the leadership of the group.</p><p>According to Powerful: “There is no crack in IPOB, our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu built IPOB in a strong rock. There is nothing anybody can do to short-change IPOB’s determination towards this divine fight for Biafra’s freedom. IPOB is Intact and not shaking.</p><p>“There is no issue in IPOB leadership and IPOB members worldwide.”</p><p>Powerful also dismissed the claims by Mefor, stressing that he is no longer a member of IPOB.</p><p>He said: “Uche Mefor has resigned from IPOB; he is no longer an IPOB member.”</p><p>When asked why Mefor resigned, Powerful responded: “Resignation of who? Because we don’t know about Uche Mefor, it’s his personal decisions and we have nothing to say about that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FuZpuhkZu%2FonnLnpidnaKotaq8jJypoquZqHqzu8KkqmahoKSvbq3FrZyrZZ6jrq6wyGaimqalqHqivtGeqq1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
