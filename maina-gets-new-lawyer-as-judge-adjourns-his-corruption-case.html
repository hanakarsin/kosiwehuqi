I have not gone to prison to see him,” he said.</p><p>It will be recalled the Federal High Court in Abuja allowed <strong>Mr Adeola Adedipe</strong> to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>withdraw from the corruption case</a></strong> against the former chairman of the Pensions Committee, Abdulrasheed Maina.</p><p>Justice Okon Abang allowed the lawyer to resign because his employer was unable to pay for his services in representing Maina.</p><p>Reacting to the submission by Maina’s new lawyer, the counsel for the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission</a></strong> (EFCC), <strong>Mohammed Abubakar</strong> opposed the request for adjournment.</p><p>He argued that the affidavits attached to the bail application showed that he was given access to his lawyers.</p><p>“It is also very clear from these affidavits that his team of counsel has free access to him and have been having interview sessions with him,” Abubakar said.</p><p>“In the light of all these, our humble submission is that the 1st defendant (Maina) is ready for everything else except the opening of his defence in the trial.”</p><p>In his ruling on the application, Justice Abang said: “The court must look at the justice of the case and take a decision that will take into consideration the competing rights of parties.”</p><p>He thereafter granted Maina’s plea based on section 396(4) of the constitution.</p><p>The case was thereafter adjourned till February 19 for Maina to open his defence and for all pending applications to be heard.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalled Maina is being prosecuted by the EFCC on 12 counts bordering on money laundering and embezzlement to the tune of N2 billion.</p><p>He had previously jumped bail but was <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>rearrested and repatriated from the Niger Republic</a></strong> where he was hiding to continue facing his trial.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed his presence</a></strong> in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital and vowed to flush out criminal herdsmen in the state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49rZqaZmaOubrPErapmppWseq2t1rKcq2WRqHqrwcOgnGaZlJ%2B8tr7NrGShoaNisLC%2B0a6nraGfo3qkrdKeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
