Some people speak because of what they want to eat, others speak to save them from problems they have if they can be saved. I and Femi are not friends, he said one of the governors he reached is Rivers State, he can’t reach me, it can’t work, I don’t like artificial things. I and Femi don’t talk,” Wike had said.</p><p>Reacting during an interview with <strong>Cally Ikpe</strong> for AIT, Fani-Kayode stated that Wike’s dictatorial attitude is driving people out of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.</p><p>According to the former Aviation Minister, three governors, Senators and members of the House of Representatives left the PDP because of the Rivers governor.</p><p>Fani-Kayode said: “He talks about integrity, which integrity does he have? I have been in the PDP since 2001 was he was still in the creeks. When did he come into the PDP? I was a minister 14 years ago. I was with a former PDP president for four years in the villa when the whole world was against us and I am very proud to serve that government. We have been in this game before 2001 and right before then, I was doing so many things. Where was this man? He was still in the creeks at that time.</p><p>“When he eventually came out. He was made a minister by President Goodluck Jonathan, he managed to crawl around and eventually got the nomination to be the governor of Rivers State. Since that time, what has he done for the PDP that was built over the years by people far older, far better than him?</p><p>“He came into the PDP and behave like a tyrant, like Hitler. Every key player that has left the PDP over the last couple of years left because of him; because of megalomania, because of his indecency, his lack of restraint and harsh words on anyone who does not agree with him.</p><p>“Jonathan helped him, he betrayed Jonathan. Rotimi Amaechi helped him, he betrayed Amaechi. Every single person that has helped this man, he has betrayed,</p><p>“He is the reason why three governors, many senators and the house of representatives members left the PDP. If Jonathan would have to leave PDP, it is for people like Wike.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BtZpykkaWvoq%2FKZrCorV2Wv6Z5x6KrpZ2iYq5ursStqZqxkaF6tLHNnaCnn12lsrC8y55kqK2kYrynec%2Bdp2aekaO2brfAsqadnV2nvKK%2F06xksKGbmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
