Unfortunately, when we were forming the PDP in 1998, we only had one issue kicking the military out.</p><p>“Then, when I became governor, we realized that we were completely different people in the same political party as people from the extreme right to the extreme left.</p><p>“We thought along the line that there should be a change especially as the party was failing, that was why we formed APC and now everybody believes it is even worse.”</p><p>According to Kwankwaso, they thought it was necessary to bring an alternative, but the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was not in hurry for such.</p><p>He noted that they carefully selected NNPP based on its manifesto, beliefs and vision.</p><p>Kwankwaso added, “We have a 152-page blueprint, we looked at all the issues and going by my antecedents as a civil servant and governor in Kano State, we believe our party is the best party to handle the crisis situation in Nigeria.”</p><p class=p1>The presidential candidate also vowed to tackle insecurity and increase the number of security agents and carry every Nigerian along in getting intelligence.</p><p class=p1>Kwankwaso promised to use his expertise as former governor of Kano state to bear in solving national issues.</p><p class=p1>He promised youth empowerment, scholarship and job creation to harness their potential.</p><p class=p1>Kwankwaso said he would build infrastructure, quality healthcare delivery, and free anti-natal for women as well as boost the economy through various interventions.</p><p class=p1>He noted, “For our administration, no Nigerian child shall be denied the opportunity to write WAEC or NECO because of their inability to pay exorbitant registration and examination fees.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FtZrCgqWK2brjEn6tmqJSleqe70WaYqZtdlrulecSvnKespZa5rcWMp6WpqF2gxKK6yrCYrKdf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
