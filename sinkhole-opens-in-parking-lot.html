She then flips her camera around to reveal what appears to be a driveway, with a large portion of concrete exterior tiling just...missing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kittykvne href=#>@kittykvne</a><p>The step stool is the only thing i could think of to act like a traffic cone 🥲 <a title=sinkhole href=#>#sinkhole</a> <a title=wheresmydad href=#>#wheresmydad</a> <a title=homeownership href=#>#homeownership</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kittykvne" href=#>♬ original sound - Kittykvne</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @kittykvne</span></figure><p>There's a gaping sinkhole that formed on the property and Kitty says he's unsure of how to address the situation: "My boyfriend and his dad were getting home from the Titans game and drove over this and it just collapsed. It's really big too it's like four or like five feet by four feet or whatever I measured it."</p><p>She then highlights the water that's collected in the sinkhole, "And it keeps bubbling like that what does that mean? I feel like a Ninja Turtle's gonna pop out. My house is gonna fly away," she laments at the end of the clip.</p><p>In a follow-up video, Kitty offered up more details on the situation: it turns out that the homeowner's association arrived at the scene of the sinkhole to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">place some cones around the hazardous site</a>.</p><p>It appeared that the maintenance crew was taking the matter seriously, however, because Kitty's next video shows some heavy machinery near the sinkhole and a group of people working to fix the problem.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kittykvne href=#>@kittykvne</a><p>Replying to @Garbagepailgenx🇵🇸🇺🇦🇨🇩</p><a title="♬ original sound - 𝑛𝑒̀𝑙𝑙𝑎ଓ" href=#>♬ original sound - 𝑛𝑒̀𝑙𝑙𝑎ଓ</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @kittykvne</span></figure><p>So was the problem ultimately rectified and if it was, what happened? Kitty provided her users with an update while she went outside to take the trash out. In the video, she showed the aftermath of what looked like some heavy-duty work that went on in front of the house.</p><p>Bricks were strewn on the lawn along with boards that we temporarily placed over the hole to prevent anyone or anything from falling into it. As she walked closer to the sinkhole and showed off the crew's handiwork it, their method of fixing it became clear: it looked like it was filled with gravel.</p><p>She lightly tested putting her foot on it, but seemed skeeved out by the idea of putting all of her weight on the mound, as she said it was giving her "quicksand vibes."</p><p>Kitty did say that someone had driven over it previously, and she pondered in the video whose "job" it was to clean up the message and replace the concrete tiling over the sinkhole.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kittykvne href=#>@kittykvne</a><p>Replying to @Have you heard about Pluto?

Sinkholes also can cause water quality problems. During a collapse, surface waters may leak into the aquifer, our underground source of drinking water."</p><p>Have you ever had to deal with a sinkhole? They can be truly terrifying, just look at this one video of a parking lot in Mumbai that depicts a vehicle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being swallowed whole by the earth and disappearing in seconds</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLavt8eoo55ln6Wyr7%2BMoqVmqJGnuKq6xmajqKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
