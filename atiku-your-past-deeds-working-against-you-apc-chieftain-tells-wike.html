According to him, Governor Wike had said so without duress to show his loyalty and commitment to the umbrella party to win the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>In reaction to Wike’s recent threat to expose some happenings in the PDP after Atiku’s interview on national television, Eze said such threat does not hold water and only presented the Governor and his cohorts as mere busybodies, saying nothing under the sun was apparently new about the PDP and Atiku.</p><p>Eze said: “Is he (Wike) going to tell us that he never wasted Rivers State funds in the wild goose chase of the PDP Presidential ticket in which he was thoroughly defeated?</p><p>“Or is he going to tell us that he never mobilised to be appointed as the Vice Presidential Candidate of the PDP? Or is Wike going to tell us that he never vowed to support whoever emerged as the PDP presidential flagbearer?</p><p>“In case he has forgotten, he should listen to the video containing his speech where he thundered and vowed that he would support, ‘to the fullest’, anybody who emerges PDP flagbearer.</p><p>“I have counseled Wike to pipe down and accept his fate as his past deeds and unwarranted and unguided utterances were the major factors that worked against him in not clinching the PDP presidential ticket or becoming the vice presidential candidate to the PDP presidential flagbearer,”&nbsp;the APC chieftain added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FwZpqsmaDCbsXOrqlmqJGowW6wxJ6brGWnpL%2Bstc2gZJqfkZ67tMCMsqauZZGlsG6vx6Kcn6yRnrtuwMSlo6xlp564pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
