While her beauty skills are undeniable, she's amassed a subscriber list of over one million largely because of her bubbly personality and her tendency to discuss everything about her life.</p><p>The YouTuber posted a video about why she's been less active on social media, and some fans feared that she was saying goodbye to vlogging. Instead, Kristi announced that she was expecting her first child, and that she had been struggling with getting pregnant for 15 years.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What is RawBeautyKristi's due date?</a> Find out more about her emotional announcement below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is RawBeautyKristi's due date?</h2><p>In her June 16 video, which was aptly entitled "I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN," the 32-year-old explained that she had been trying to get pregnant for more than 15 years. She and her husband Zack, who she wed in 2010, had come to terms with the fact that they would not have kids.&nbsp;</p><p>She had filmed every pregnancy test that she took for the last 12 years, in case any of them turned out to be positive.</p><p>Kristi took her pregnancy test on March 29, 2020, which may have been done when she was a few weeks pregnant. Though she did not reveal when her due date is (she noted that she would in a future Q&A vlog), the YouTube star may have waited to announce the news until she was in her second trimester.&nbsp;</p><p>The makeup artist is likely due in November or December of 2020.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">RawBeautyKristi chronicled her infertility in the vlog.</h2><p>In several of her past videos, Kristi had discussed her infertility, and she had been candid with her viewers that she was not likely going to be able to have kids. What viewers didn't know, however, was how many years Kristi spent coming to terms with this reality.</p><p>After she and Zack wed in 2010, Kristi enlisted the help of fertility specialists, which they used throughout the first years of their marriage.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My Valentine until the day I die ðŸ’• I love you with my entire heart forever and always.

"We didn't want 'trying to conceive' to be the be-all-end-all for our lives. After 15 years of hundreds of doctors appointments, and being told we would never conceive â€” This was 12398420938490234290% A COMPLETE surprise and shock to us."</p><p>In the video, Kristi showcased several clips from years past, in which she got emotional about wanting to get pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>"It would be the best day of my life. It would be the best s--t in the world if i got a positive pregnancy test," Kristi said back in 2010.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I feel like I'm never going to be a mother and that I am going to be childless forever," Kristi explained in another clip from that year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"Moms always tell me how much they didn't realize what love was until they had a kid. Let's say I'm like 33 and I just find out that I'm pregnant â€” which I'm pretty sure is never going to happen. Everything that I have when I die and when he [Zack] dies, there's nobody to give it to," Kristi said in a 2013 video moment, which almost directly foreshadowed what ended up happening in 2020.</p><p>"I don't cry thinking about me not being a mom, I cry thinking about Zack not being a dad," Kristi explained.&nbsp;</p><p>When she got a positive result in March of 2020, Kristi was in disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't get pregnant. I don't ovulate. I don't have that. It doesn't work," Kristi said toward the end of her video.</p><p>Congratulations to Kristi and Zack!&nbsp;</p><p>You can watch RawBeautyKristi's emotional pregnancy announcement video below.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp664ecGemK6sqWK4s7XSraBmnKWaeqWt054%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
