While <a href=#>Kenny</a>'s 26-year-old son, Bricen, and 24-year-old triplets, Madison, Cassidy, and Taylor, are based in the U.S., Armando's 6-year-old daughter lives in San Felipe, Mexico.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kenny from '90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way' has a 26-year-old son and 24-year-old triplets.</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way addresses Kenny's<strong> </strong>and Armando's struggles with societal prejudices, capturing the latter's fear of street harassment and the difficulties of introducing his chosen other to his conservative-minded parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous episodes captured Kenny's attempts to unpack why Armando is disinclined to hold hands in public, alongside scenes portraying how he tried to come out to his parents — who didn't respond well to the news the first time around.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way mostly focuses on Kenny's move to San Felipe, Mexico. However, there are a few mentions to Kenny's three girls, 26-year-old Bricen, 24-year-old Madison, Cassidy, and Taylor, and Madison's 3-year-old son, Cooper, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her Instagram profile, Madison and her partner, Joseph Torres, are the proud parents of one kid, Cooper. As a passionate gardener, she often takes it to social media to upload her latest acquisitions and to showcase some of her most beautiful bouquets.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Like Madison,<strong> </strong>Cassidy (or Cass) is a nature-lover with a deep-seated interest in vegan skin and hair care and far beyond. According to her Instagram page, she is also the owner of Las Nubes Coffee, a social enterprise that sells certified organic coffee to raise more money to re-house homeless dogs.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to an interest in everything fashion and styling-related, Taylor enjoys going on trips to cities like London, Kuršėnai, Lithuania, or Rosarito, Mexico. She often uses social media to chronicle her latest adventures and to document some of her fiercest outfits. Out of Kenny's four kids, Bricen is the least active on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>As Madison's Instagram page reveals, the family often comes together to celebrate landmark moments like Madison's son's, Cooper's third birthday. It appears that they also like to spend time together on the beautiful beaches of Baja California Sur, Mexico, among other activities.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Armando has a 6-year-old daughter, Hannah.</h2><p>Armando has one kid, a 6-year-old daughter named Hannah, whom he's been raising on his own ever since his wife, Laura, lost her life in a car accident. It's understood that she was expecting their second child at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Kenny and Armando first bonded on a website catering specifically to single dads, and it's perhaps not too far-fetched to hypothesize that it was their love of their respective families that first brought them closer to each other. While it might be uncertain what's next for the duo — will they settle down in Mexico, or ...? — one thing is for sure. They will always have their beautiful kids to rely on.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way every Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKvuthmcGlllJbGbrLImqWcnV2gtqW%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
