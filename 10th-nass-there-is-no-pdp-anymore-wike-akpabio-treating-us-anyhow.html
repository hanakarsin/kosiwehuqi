This has never happened before.”</p><p>The lawmakers, who stated that there is no PDP anymore, disclosed that individuals were only fighting for themselves.</p><p>He said, “There is no PDP anymore; we can’t collectively do anything anymore because there is no party to back us. Individuals are only fighting for themselves.</p><p>“Some have even taken over, calling themselves the ‘new generation lawmakers’; these are those who came from the House of Reps.</p><p>“They are so lawless; in fact, they have turned the Senate upside down. Our rules are no longer respected. It is such a sad thing.”</p><p>Another PDP lawmaker stated that the main opposition party would likely not survive its current crisis, noting that even the National Working Committee of the party had been so penetrated that it was like it was being run by the former Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike.</p><p>The lawmaker said, “Wike has taken over the PDP. Nobody will fight for us. We are now being treated anyhow by Akpabio and his men.</p><p>“No PDP lawmaker will like to talk to you so as not to be used as a scapegoat. Our minority leader is subservient to the majority; we don’t have a party to fight for us.</p><p>“As it is now, we are like sheep without a shepherd.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FsZmpopJ16r63SrGStoJWnsm610malqGWgmb1urc2ypKiqlWLEqrfEZpikqJGXtrB506ucmqyZo7RuwdJmmKexmKTEcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
