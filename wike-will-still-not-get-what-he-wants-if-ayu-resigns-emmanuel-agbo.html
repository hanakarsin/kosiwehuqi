If truly the issues are not individualistic, if it is on the north and south dichotomy as they have made us to believe, the person that is supposed to assume that office immediately, assuming Ayu resigns today, is Umar from the North-East, and Umar is not only from the north, he is from the North-East where our candidate comes from. Unless they are calling for his resignation, and then he will ask them what he has done.</p><p>&nbsp;“There are constitutional impediments to this call. Section 47 (6), says that in the event that there is a vacancy created in any executive committee at any level, the executive committee at that level will go to the area and the zone to bring a replacement. It means that even if Ayu willingly resigns, I know that the North-Central where he comes from will go and ask for their position.</p><p>“My take is that it will create multiple problems both constitutional for the party and resolving any particular problem on hand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BqZrChm5p6uLXLpWSsrJmhuW66zq1koJ2kYsSprdNmn55lp5a7tb%2BMop1mmamqerOx0qKep6tdmrqurc2unKVlkZyvsHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
