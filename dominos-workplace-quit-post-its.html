She put in her two-weeks notice via a sticky note, keeping in line with her written correspondence with the Domino's pizza chain she works for.</p><p>She documented her post-it notes in a short montage she uploaded to her TikTok account: @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">idonotknowwhatiamherefor</a>. The video begins with the camera focused on a pink post-it that reads: "Stop scheduling me by myself on weekends.
