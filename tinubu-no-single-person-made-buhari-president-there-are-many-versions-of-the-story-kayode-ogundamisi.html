It was a collective effort of multiple coalitions with Tinubu being a major part of that and the then political environment making it possible for Buhari to get the vote of people who will not ordinarily vote for him,” Ogundamisi wrote on his verified Twitter handle.</p><p>“Whilst Tinubu’s contribution can’t be minimised, the same goes with the contributions of other members of that coalition and NONE told us the reward was for Buhari to hand over Nigeria to them. Atiku in 2023 will be contesting under the same conditions that made Buhari President.</p><p>He argued that just as Tinubu has been having his preferred candidates in who becomes Governor of Lagos State, so does President Buhari has a right to have a preferred candidate to take over from him in 2023.</p><p>Ogundamisi however argued that the final decision on who becomes the next President of the country lies with Nigerians at the polls.</p><p>“No one Man is “Awade in Yorubaland”. Tinubu rightly had preferred candidates and has influenced the emergence of Lagos Governors since he left public office, why does he think Buhari shouldn’t have his own preferred candidate in the National election?</p><p>“What Buhari should not do is impose any candidate on the APC. He can lobby, he can campaign but should respect the wishes of the APC stakeholders in a free and fair primaries. The Presidency of Nigeria is not the entitlement of any Region or any Individual. It is a context.”</p><p>He submitted that whoever eventually emerges the APC candidate for the 2023 elections will have a lot of work to do in convincing Nigerians to vote for the party.</p><p>In his statement, Ogundamisi pointed out that the survival of Nigeria is greater than the political ambition of any politician and no person should be forced on Nigerians, adding that the APC primaries must be free and fair.</p><p>“Lastly, Y’all had better start preparing for the possibility of an @atiku Presidency as even before all this drama, the angst in the country is towards a change in the party in National leadership. So any APC candidate still have a very long road to travel to get to the villa.</p><p>“I’ve said it before and let me say it again, no man can play God, not Tinubu and not Buhari. God gives power, if you like scream from now till 2089. Tinubu’s political survival in the South West was a COLLECTIVE EFFORT! With many INDIVIDUALS contributing to that survival.</p><p>“No one can underestimate Tinibus contributions. BAT can not underestimate the contributions of individuals at great personal sacrifice to his own personal and political survival, if he’s feeling betrayed, we have individuals who felt betrayed by him but still chose to respect him.</p><p>“The greatest Yoruba leader was Chief Obafemi Awolowo, he never felt entitled, he united Yoruba and even in the face of opposition within Yorubaland he found a way of bringing the young hot heads together. Awo ran a collective leadership, he did not play God. That is leadership.</p><p>“And this threats of bringing APC down if Tinubu does not get the ticket at the #APCPresidentialPrimaries? Who gives a f****? We had many political parties that have come and go. What is more important is the survival of Nigeria. Parties can always disband, align and realign.</p><p>“BAT’s version of how Buhari became President is Tinubus version. Tunde Bakare @atiku @elrufai @bukolasaraki Rotimi Amaechi, Rochas Okorocha and many others have their own versions. The version that is obvious to the general public is that Nigerians chose to give Buhari a chance.</p><p>“The President and the APC owes Tinubu and others only one thing and that is an open, free and transparent #APCPresidentialPrimaries.</p><p>“No individual should force another individual to drop their ambition to serve just like we saw during the charade of an “election” of APC NEC,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49sZq2hnqqvtnnNqGSsoZ6cuaZ5z56prKeeYrqisMRmma6gkae2brzRnqqinJWjwW7Ax56pnmWRp7JuucCnsGaulafAqrvNrGSonl2ptaZ50q2mq7FdoK66u8OeZKifpaOxornIrKBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
