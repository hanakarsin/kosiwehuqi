You have a self-checkout!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @thecoinchannel</span></figure><p>He narrates his actions in the video as he scans a bottle of Coca-Cola on the machine right after pointing out that the grocery store has a Coinstar machine just a few feet away: "You have a self-checkout?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The shopper shows up a handful of coins and then tosses them into the coin feeder on the self-checkout machine. The device counts all of the coins he placed into the machine, which feed into it little by little.</p><p>He then brings up a prompt on the self-serve kiosk and presses a dialogue box. "All you do is hit cancel payment." The machine then dispenses the amount of money he placed into the machine with cash instead.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The man shows off two fresh crisp bills, "Voila, no fee."</p><p>The clip then cuts to Eric who applauds the man's post, "That's just genius. No fees, self-checkout fees are gonna be long."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, because Eric's channel is dedicated to all things coins, he wasn't just satisfied in highlighting the Coinstar-fee-skirting hack, but put in a tidbit of information for folks to look out for when they were at the grocery store: the Wilma Man Keller quarter.</p><p>He's referring to a specific variant of the coin that has a "crack" running through the back of it, which, if found, could reel in those in possession of the coin some big bucks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Eric says: "Do me one favor before you cash in your quarters â€” or put them into a self-checkout. Check to see if any of the quarters are from 2022."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He goes on to explain to folks why they should carefully inspect these coins: "Then, turn it over and see if it's the Wilma Man Keller design. Tons of those 2022 Wilma Man Keller quarters are in circulation."</p><p>"Then it's pretty simple, see if there's a big crack going across the back of it. Too many people are making money on these so I had to share it with all of you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He then highlights various eBay listings that shows how much these particular coins are going for: "They're selling for over $400, another one for $480, another one for $500, and one just sold a couple days ago for $535."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There were some commenters who said that they choose to pay for their items at self-checkout lanes using nothing but their coins, bypassing the cash redemption altogether: "the target cashiers look at you funny when you pay 120.00 in quarters, nickels & dimes.."</p><p>And then there was someone else who said that they discovered they were in possession of one of these "cracked" coins: "I have one of those I found itbin my pocket yesterday and I just looked and it has the crack but idk where to sell it"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another TikTok user said that it's common practice for them to use coins first before placing cash for their goods in self-checkout machines: "I always empty my change into the self-checkout before my cash."</p><p>What do you think of this "hack?" Have you long discovered this and have been enjoying the bounties of coin-paying/redeeming living without fees for quite some time? Or are you a more card/mobile payment kinda person yourself?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyqutKtmKtlnZawqbXNnmSsnZybeqS0xJyiqK2kYrWir8o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
