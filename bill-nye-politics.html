Outside of his award-winning PBS series, Bill is a well-known mechanical engineer and science advocate. Of course, he isn't afraid to get political when getting scientific.</p><p>Aside from appearing as a TV personality in shows like Inside Amy Schumer and <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>, Bill Nye has had his hands in several fields. He originally designed components for Boeing 747 airplanes and even applied to become an astronaut. Though he was never accepted, he would later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">design tools for Mars rovers</a> in the early 2000s and served as the vice president for the Planetary Society, eventually becoming CEO.</p><p>Bill Nye very clearly loves talking science. Within politics, he's always urged that the U.S. government take serious action when it comes to using science to protect our way of life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There's political science, then there's Bill Nye's politics in science.</h2><p>Though his political alignment isn't explicitly stated, we can safely assume that Bill Nye is a bona fide democrat. He frequently met with Barack Obama during his presidency to discuss climate change with him and the administration. He also openly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">supported Barack's reelection</a> bid in 2012.</p><p>Of course, Bill also isn't afraid to go wherever science needs him. During the infamous era of the Trump administration, Bill drew criticism for attending the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 State of the Union</a> at the invitation of Jim Bridenstine, a known climate change denier and Trump's controversial pick for NASA administrator. Having never endorsed Trump for the president-elect, Bill voiced his intention to maintain a relationship with the White House in order to make sure science prevails within the troubled administration.</p><p>"While the Congressman and I disagree on a great many issues – we share a deep respect for NASA and its achievements and a strong interest in the future of space exploration," Bill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. "My attendance tomorrow should not be interpreted as an endorsement of this administration, or of Congressman Bridenstine’s nomination, or seen as an acceptance of the recent attacks on science and the scientific community."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>In 2019, he wasn't afraid to get a little unhinged. On the satirical news show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, he voiced his explicit support for Green New Deal democratic policies which would impose carbon pricing to de-incentivize the use of carbon emissions and reduce the effect of climate change. In 2020, Bill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a> democratic candidate Joe Biden for president, urging people to vote in order to further potential world-saving politics.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bill Nye's support for Biden persists on TikTok.</h2><p>Bill Nye continues to support <a href=#>President Biden</a>, even on TikTok. In a spoof of his old show segment, "Consider the Following," Bill appeared alongside the president advocating for better U.S. infrastructure and more policies for combatting climate change. Together, they spoke about the importance of prioritizing electric cars and weatherizing houses to reduce our carbon footprint. The video even drew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ire of conservative critics</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@billnye href=#>@billnye</a><p>Consider the following… <a title=infrastructure href=#>#infrastructure</a> is cool.</p><a title="♬ original sound - Bill Nye" href=#>♬ original sound - Bill Nye</a></figure><p>Bill Nye has gone from teaching kids on PBS to stressing the importance of countering the effects of climate change on whatever platform he can find. He's worked to guide democrats in the right direction and has grown unafraid of ticking off conservatives in the process.</p><p>You're right, Bill. Science does rule.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7atuIynsJ5loKS5qsDInKo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
