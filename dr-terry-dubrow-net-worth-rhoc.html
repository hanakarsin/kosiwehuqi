That's what really matters, right?</p><p>The doctor-turned-reality-star obviously made most of his big bucks from his work in the medical field, as he's one of the top plastic and reconstructive surgeons in America. But, being the face of multiple reality television shows surely amped up his already fruitful net worth.</p><p>Dr. Terry Dubrow has been a media presence ever since his appearance on Fox's wildly controversial reality series The Swan in 2004 (don't worry, we'll get to that blasphemous piece of pop culture history later). Being a celebrity doctor essentially creates a double duty income, and, in turn, a stunning net worth. So, what is the doc's net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span><p>Dr. Paul Nassif and Dr. Terry Dubrow on 'Botched'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Dr. Terry Dubrow's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the doc has a net worth of $50 million. As mentioned, Dr. Terry Dubrow was first introduced in the media when he participated in the 2004 reality series The Swan — which was thankfully only granted two seasons before dying off.</p><p>The premise sees women with low self-esteem compete in an unusually superficial, almost cult-like beauty pageant. They go head-to-head after transformation for three months by a team of professionals (a coach, surgeon, dentist, trainer, and, probably most importantly, therapist).</p><p>Dr. Terry was one of the series's plastic surgeons. If you haven't caught on, the show aims to transform "ugly ducklings" into beautiful swans. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Fab</a>, the doc relayed that everyone had "very good intentions" making the show. "It's sort of the real-life version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show," he stated.
