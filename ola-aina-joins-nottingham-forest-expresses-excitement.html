About a month after, he joined Nottingham Forest on a free transfer.</p><p>Aina is Forest’s first new signing in this summer transfer window. He agreed to a deal that was initially for two years, with the possibility of a year extension.</p><p>The 26-year-old has spent time on loan at Fulham and Hull City and rose through the ranks at Chelsea. He is fully aware of what to anticipate at the City Ground both on and off the field.</p><p>In his first interview as the club’s new signing, the Nigeria international said, “I’m very excited to be here and I can’t wait to get started.</p><p>“I wanted to be back on English soil again and Forest is a club which has an exciting project and team.</p><p>“The manager as well, what he wants from the team is something which I want to buy into. He’s told me it’s a family club, he’s told me we have a great bunch of players and he’s told me I’ll enjoy it here.</p><p>“It’s exciting to be back playing in the Premier League. It’s the best league in the world and I always want to challenge myself.</p><p>“I know some of the boys well already, which is good for me, but I’m excited to meet the rest of my teammates and get to know everyone. I saw Forest in action last season and the fans are as loud as can be throughout the whole game, which is something I’m relishing and can’t wait to experience. I can’t wait for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FsZqikkWKuqrrAZqGooZ6oeq%2B7062gp5%2BYlrpuss6rnKysXZrFsb7ErKqeq12axaS1056knqakZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
