The continent has far and wide enjoyed some relative peace, but that is only the beginning when it comes to living and working. Apart from peace, people need food and water, but these are still just the basics. The best African countries to live and work in 2020 are those that have gone the extra mile to ensure all the possible aspects necessary for a working environment are catered for. Some might assume that the best countries to live and work in are the most developed, but this is not true because one has to look at the cost of living.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Living and working in a country is dependent on several things, the first of which is political and economic stability. Political stability guarantees the protection of life at all times, while economic stability is the foundation of working towards profit maximization.

Mauritius</h3><p class=align-left>According to the World Bank 2020 Doing Business report, Mauritius is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ranked 13th worldwide</a> and the 1st in the African continent with a score of 81.5 points out of 100. There were four significant reforms identified as being at the core of Mauritius, leading in ease of doing business. These reforms include the outsourcing of sewerage design and connection, which has contributed to increased hygiene and sanitation improvement.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the country has done major reforms in facilitating cross-border trade. This means investors do not need to worry about delays at border entry points. One of the most critical reforms which Mauritius has done better than other countries is the simplification of ownership transfers while reducing transfer costs at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>The last reform identified by the World Bank is the introduction of a recourse mechanism for the publication of service standards. Mauritius also ranks high when it comes to payment of taxes, obtaining a building permit, and the protection of minority investors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/42a99a23a3ba7b21.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most expensive cities in Africa for expats in 2024</span></p></a><h3>2. Rwanda</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg><p class=align-left>While many people have failed to agree on the legitimacy and whether President Kagame of Rwanda is a dictator or not, no one can deny that his country is far better off than where it was when he took power. 2019 was the first time Rwanda had emerged in the top 30 states of the World Bank’s Doing Business report. In 2020, the country has a score of 76.5 points out of 100.</p><p class=align-left>This effectively meant that Rwanda is position 38 globally on the ease of doing business and 2nd on the African continent. Over the last ten years, Rwanda has implemented about 52 reforms related to the business and investment environment in the country. Some of the core reforms undertaken by the country include fast-tracking the building permit process, the introduction of risk-based inspections, and increasing quality control in construction.</p><p class=align-left>The country has also introduced online services for registering goods hence making the process of property transfer easy. With the help of the country’s land registry, one can transfer property within seven days at the cost of 0.1% of the property value, making Rwanda 2nd in the world on this indicator. Rwanda is also doing considerably well in terms of access to credit, protection of minority investors, and payment of taxes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ad6591d26d7d9b0d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most visited countries in Africa</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 most visited countries in Africa</p><h3>3. Morocco</h3><p class=align-left>World Bank’s Doing Business report ranks Morocco 53rd worldwide and 3rd in Africa with a score of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">73.4 points.</a> It is, therefore, a leader in matters ease of working and living in the North African region. Two critical reforms put Morocco on the map. The country has been effective when it comes to the reduction of company creation time.</p><p class=align-left>Morocco has eliminated the requirement of affixing physical stamps and replacing it with the use of an integrated taxation system. Also, the country ranks high in payment of taxes due to the facilitation of payment procedures and at the same time, simplifying and generalizing those procedures. The environment is conducive for start-ups, especially when it comes to the execution of contracts. This makes it one of the cheapest African countries to live in.</p><h3>4. Kenya</h3><p class=align-left>In East Africa, Kenya continues to be a leader and is fourth in ease of doing business in Africa. On the global stage, the country is 56th, leaving much to be desired on its 73.2 points score. The country has been hailed on its partnership with the private sector to provide a better business environment. In 2018, Kenya implemented the highest number of business-related reforms on the African continent and has improved by 53 positions globally in the last three years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1c75ef6a6b09c657.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of SMEs in Kenya: Top 100 companies to watch in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Among the significant reforms undertaken is the improvement of the reliability of electricity by adding more distribution lines and transformers.

This is thanks to the country’s ease of obtaining a building permit.</p><p class=align-left>It takes an average of eleven days and about nine administrative procedures to set up a business in Tunisia. The country is efficient when it comes to connection to the electricity grid and property registration. It is also one of the highest paying countries in Africa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/250ce86d9dd0f991.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 most marketable courses in Kenya 2024: top-ranked degrees</span></p></a><h3>6.

It has a score of 67.0 points when indicators such as development finance, export facilitation, human resources, and skill development are evaluated.</p><p class=align-left>The country is still a leader when it comes to tourist attraction, but on foreign investment, it is lagging. However, rapid reforms have been made, such as the creation of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) responsible for providing incentives to domestic and foreign investors.</p><p class=align-left>South Africa is also noted for its protection of minorities reforms that place it 24th worldwide.

Zambia</h3><p class=align-left>Zambia is the 7th best African country to live and work in. Globally, it is ranked 85th with a score of 66.9 points. Zambia has come a long way and finds itself among the top ten economies with the most notable improvements. Three current regulatory reforms have put the country on the map.</p><p class=align-left>The first of these is access to credit through the new Movable Property Tax Act. Secondly, Zambia has been able to establish a new unified collateral registry that has eliminated many unnecessary processes. The third reform involves the reduction of tax rates of transferring property.</p><p class=align-left>The cross-border trading is much better in Zambia after the country implemented a web-customs data management platform that facilitates importing and exporting activities. The country is exceptional when it comes to access to credit and is doing considerably well in the payment of taxes.</p><h3>8. Botswana</h3><p class=align-left>Botswana is 8th in Africa and 78th globally with a score of 66.2 points. It is easy to obtain a business permit in Botswana, and the business environment is relatively favourable to investors. Likewise, registering property is no hassle in this country, but the connection to electricity is not the best.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5bd9ac4d6b97fc9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of houses in Kenya (with pictures)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Botswana has a vibrant mining industry and has always been a destination of choice for foreign investors.
