I will kiss the guys and the beautiful ladies. Everyone, I will just give you a big fat kiss," said Trump who entered the venue without a mask but dished out masks to his followers.<h2><strong>Tested negative</strong></h2><p class=align-left>White House assistant press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Monday, October 12, said Trump had tested negative for COVID-19 consecutively using the Abbott BinaxNow antigen card.</p>"The comprehensive data is connected with the CDC's guidelines for removal of transmission-based precautions have informed our medical team's assessment that the president is not infectious to others, " said McEnany.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB Feed</p><p class=align-left>Trump's claims that he was immune to the new disease came hardly a day after Twitter fact-checked a message from the US head of state that claimed he was now resistant to the respiratory disease.</p><p class=align-left>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), scientists are yet to establish whether or not contracting COVID-19 gives a person hard immunity which Trump claimed to have.</p><p class=align-left>This could be the basis upon which Twitter used to flag the tweet and classify it as potentially misleading and harmful.</p><p class=align-left>Earlier, Twitter added a warning notice on Trump's message which claimed COVID-19 was not as dangerous as the common cold.</p><p class=align-left>He used his Monday speech to tear into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden whom he claimed will "reinstate lockdown and delay vaccine production" if elected US president.</p><h2><strong>Quick discharge</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Trump also defended his quick discharge from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where he was admitted after his positive diagnosis stating that as a president, he could "not just lock yourself in a bunker" because of COVID-19.</p>"When you are the president, you cannot just lock yourself in a bunker and say that you are not going to bother with the world.
