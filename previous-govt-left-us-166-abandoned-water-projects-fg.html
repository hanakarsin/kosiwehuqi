And we made a strategic decision that we are going to concentrate more on completing as many of the ongoing and abandoned projects that we found.</p><p>“So we have not been in the habit of starting new projects, although we are coming to that in due course.</p><p>Adamu further explained that the abandoned projects include irrigation, dam and sanitation projects.</p><p>“The 166 projects include 38 irrigation projects, 37 dam projects and others. After doing a technical audit in 2016, we prioritised them into high, medium and low priority. And that has been what is driving us.</p><p>“We also have a goal to complete viable projects only.”</p><p>Attributing the abandoned project to poor financing, the Minister said his administration is seeking ways to source funds beyond the national allocation.</p><p>Adamu added: “Water infrastructure is a money guzzler and this is why several past projects have not been completed.</p><p>“So, we thought we could find some other ways to raise finance to complete these projects. We had to think outside the box.</p><p>“We are now mobilising finance for these projects asides the normal budgetary allocation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49uZqmqlau2sMHSZp6orqRiuaay02asrGVha4NurcGapZ2nnpqxbsPArZyrZaCnvKuxwq2qZp6XZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
