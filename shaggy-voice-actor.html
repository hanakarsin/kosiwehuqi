They survived more kidnappings, mysterious disappearances, and unexpected conflicts than the average rom com duo, and it was time a movie zoomed in on their special relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the first-ever episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! was released as early as 1969, the intricate details of Shaggy' and Scoob's relationship remained relatively unexplored up until now.</p><p>It was time we took a closer look at the duo. Take Shaggy. What should we know about him? Who will play the character in the forthcoming movie?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Shaggy's voice actor?&nbsp;</h2><p>Will Forte made his actorial debut on The Late Show With David Letterman – playing the character of Snow Shovel Murder Victim, no less – which was quickly followed by roles in 30 Rock, The Last Man on Earth, and The Lego Movie.&nbsp;He even had a part in 30 Rock, playing Paul L'Astname, Jenna Maroney's transgender partner.&nbsp;</p><p>But Will didn't start out as an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>He first became involved in the hectic world of show business as a writer, developing comedy scripts like the aforementioned "Show Shovel Murder Scene" for The Late Show With David Letterman, before joining Saturday Night Live and That '70s Show as a writer and producer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>As a comedian, he astounded fans with his super-dry, acerbic sense of humor, writing and performing an ode to his beard on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon – Pierce Brosnan's facial hair in Robinson Crusoe is a sleazy stubble in comparison – or discussing how he regifted a pillow with a graphic picture on it to his mom on Late Night with Seth Meyers.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a> reveals, Will even managed to get away with performing a tiny physical experiment while working at Saturday Night Live. To assess the intricate functioning of gravity, he decided to chuck co-worker Eric Slovin's food out of the window, accompanied by a $20 note for good measure. Eric was given the mighty task of waiting for the package to land on the street level – and has reputedly handled the experiment with a surprising amount of sophistication and grace.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Youtube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In Scoob!, Will will appear alongside Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and the like.&nbsp;</h2><p>The forthcoming full feature movie by Warner Bros will chronicle Shaggy' and Scooby-Doo's friendship from Day 1 till now, showing us how the mischievous duo met, and how they developed one of the most special connections to be shown on the big screen.&nbsp;</p><p>As per usual, there will be no shortage of wild adventures. In fact, Shaggy and Scoob will get themselves into a myriad of trouble, and even become the unfortunate victims of alien abduction at one point.&nbsp;</p><p>With Will's incredible talents and masterful sense of humor, there is one thing we can safely predict: the movie is bound to be impeccable.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWis8ayZK%2BnmZiybq3Craar</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
