Throughout his short career, Tupac established himself as a true lyricist, political activist, and visionary.</p><p>Aside from Tupac’s amazing ear for music, fans adored his sense of style. It’s common for many rappers to have their flair — think <a href=#>Nelly</a> rocking a Band-Aid or <a href=#>Kanye West’s</a> preppy style in the ‘00s.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for Tupac, the rapper was rarely without a bandanna on his head — whether he styled it as a bow front or headband.</p><p>On that note, some folks are wondering if Tupac donned bandannas for a particular reason.</p><p>Here’s the 4-1-1.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Tupac wear a bandanna?</h2><p>Interestingly, Tupac has never shared why he wore bandannas so much.</p><p>Some folks initially believed that Tupac wore bandannas due to gang affiliations.

Some of the items included jewelry he wore, as well as handwritten letters Tupac sent to fans while he was in prison.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL agazine</a> shares that some of the rapper’s bandannas — a blue worn bandanna and an unworn red bandanna — that were provided by a “close friend of Tupac’s” were also included in the auction.</p><p>As of this writing, the bandannas are not on the auction site, which means they have likely been sold. The outlet shares that the bandannas were estimated to sell between $2,000 to $4,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aspaWupHnWnpirZZFir6K6w5qlp5k%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
