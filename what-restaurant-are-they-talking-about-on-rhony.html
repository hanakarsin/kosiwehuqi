Brynn and Sai explained that they didn't go to Erin's restaurant because it was out of style and not a "cool" place to eat. Erin believed the outing was more about bonding than going to a trendy spot.</p><p>The restaurant debacle continued until Jenna‚Äôs apartment party at the end of the episode. However, the producers censored the business‚Äôs name every time it was mentioned, likely because of the cast's damaging comments about it. On social media, viewers begged the show to name the restaurant, though it never happened in the episode.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WHAT RESTAURANT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT üò≠ <a href=#>#RHONY</a></p>‚Äî tori (@housesofhilton) <a href=#>July 17, 2023</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The restaurant in question <a href=#>#RHONY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/I4dATXVweE</a></p>‚Äî Stephen (@dcsteve5) <a href=#>July 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Nonetheless, with a few context clues, several fans familiar with the NYC social scene shared their opinions on what restaurant <a href=#>the RHONY cast</a> kept bleeping out.
