The family is the previous owner of the iconic brewing company Anheuser-Busch (think Budweiser!), before it was sold in 2008 to InBev.</p><p>The reality series will follow this beer-loving family as "they navigate their family legacy, relationship drama, and new endeavors." Aside from loads of drinking and hilarious antics, one breakout star that we're sure will immediately capture your heart is the ever-so-charming Gussie Busch.</p><p>Dubbed as the "ladies man" of his family, the show will follow Gussie's girlfriend drama.

But when he starts sneaking around and dating one of his sister Grace's friends, he finds himself in a serious relationship -- and in serious trouble with his family."&nbsp;</p><p>Though this "party animal" sure loves to have a good time, who is his girlfriend, the one who has stolen his heart?</p><p>While MTV teased that Gussie will get into a full-fledged love affair during the show, his social media suggests he is currently single. Last Valentine's Day, the 24-year-old shared a pic of himself and (then?) girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louise Keefer,</a> which he captioned with a heart.</p><p>Similarly, Louise's last Instagram post with Gussie was shared on Jan. 1, 2019. It appears Louise and Gussie may have started dating back in 2018.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>❤️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>August “Gussie” Busch</a> (@gussiebusch) on Feb 14, 2019 at 7:03am PST</p></figure><p>However, the pair have known each other for quite some time.

And, they're holding nothing back! Eldest daughter Haley spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, revealing that her engagement was even caught on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>"When all of us signed up to do this, we said that if we’re going to do it, we’re going to put everything out there. We’re not going to hold back. This is our real lives and we’re going to be true to who we are, and so we all really did that. That was a part of my life and something that happened," she said.
