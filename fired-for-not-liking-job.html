I figured that when my time came to start work, I would be fine as long as I showed up, did the work, and didn't make any massive errors like <a href=#>accidentally zeroing out a store's entire inventory</a>.</p><p>But when I joined the workforce, I saw some crazy stuff firsthand. On top of that, I started spending way too much time on <a href=#>TikTok</a> watching folks who got the boot discuss why and I ultimately realized that it’s really not that hard to get terminated. People get fired for all sorts of reasons that don’t always seem fair. For example, this <a href=#>man got fired</a> just days after he told his boss that his girlfriend was pregnant.</p><p>This woman got fired for <a href=#>posting a TikTok during a remote meeting</a> — let it be known that this meeting was at 4:30 a.m.</p><p>That said, I found another story of an employee getting fired for a reason that just didn’t sit right with me. Why was she fired? Oh, well, she didn’t like her job.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman says she was fired from her job because she didn't like it.</h2><p>Comedian Yvette Segan (<a href=# style=text-align:left rel="noopener noreferrer">@yevit</a>) took to TikTok to discuss why she got fired from her job. If she looks familiar, it’s because she’s quite popular on the platform. You may have seen her video where she discussed how her dad weirdly decided to tell Yvette that <a href=#>he loved her mother more than he loved her</a>.</p><p>Anyway, her latest trauma dump seemingly involves getting fired for not being head over heels in love with her job.</p><p>“So I got fired. No cause. Just vibes,” she says as she begins her video. “And when I was like why — why is this happening? They were like ‘Well, it just seems like you’re not really invested long term. It seems like you really don’t like your job.’”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@yevit href=#>@yevit</a><p>Millennials are destroying the workplace</p><a title="♬ original sound - Yvette" href=#>♬ original sound - Yvette</a></figure><p>Yvette leans towards the camera with a confused look on her face. “And I was like, ‘Yeah of course I don't like my job,'” she says. “Since when are we supposed to like our jobs? I thought you just bootstrap it and muscle through the day like my Republican dad told me.”</p><p>As she ends her video, she says: “God, corporate America is just getting out of control.”</p><p>Yvette's candid video opened the floodgates for others to share their stories of how their companies dumped them for reasons that just make you want to say "make it make sense!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@yevit</a></figure><p>"Tell me why my bestie got fired for not being a team player when he literally just wanted to eat his lunch by himself," shared one user.</p><p>Another user claimed she got fired because the new hires — who she trained — had learned faster.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@yevit</a></figure><p>A third user wrote: "I just got fired cause I put my personal life above the company. The reason? My husband was coughing up blood and I took him to the ER."</p><p>Other users commented on how bosses have such unrealistic expectations for employees from asking them to work for free "out of love" to questioning them about why they aren't smiling 24/7 on the clock.</p><p>While it may be frustrating for employers to have an employee who isn't naturally enamored with their job, it isn't uncommon.</p><p>In Gallup's <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">State of the Global Workplace: 2022</a> report, approximately 60 percent of workers surveyed reported being emotionally detached at work and 19 percent went as far as to say they were being miserable.</p><p>Better yet, only one-third of the workers who participated reported feeling engaged at work. That said, a lot of people don't like their jobs. Perhaps instead of getting rid of these workers, employers should work on finding ways to make employees' roles more fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7azscNmnaiqXaO8tXnLoqKippdit7Cu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
