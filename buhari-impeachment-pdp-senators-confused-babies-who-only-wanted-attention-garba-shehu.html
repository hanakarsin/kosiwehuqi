In the last 24 hours, two more Chibok girls were freed, in addition to the three brought home last week.</p><p>“These kinds of headline grabbing stunts for which the opposition is now well known serve no one, least of all their constituents. We would respectfully remind them that it is those same constituents that they were elected to serve, and are paid to do so with public money.</p><p>“We would welcome their collaboration in our efforts to solve the problems Nigerians face on a daily basis. No one is asking them to waste their time attempting to impeach a democratically elected President at the end of his second term – certainly not their constituents.</p><p>“They should ask themselves: do they want to be in government or do they want to be in the headlines? If they want to be in government they should start acting like it and stop undermining Nigerian voters.”</p><h2>Buhari Can’t Be Impeached</h2><p>In an earlier reaction, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina had said the lawmakers planning to impeach his principal <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>won’t be successful</a></strong>.</p><p>He stated this after the PDP lawmakers issued a six-week ultimatum to President Buhari to tackle the security issue in the country or face impeachment.</p><p>Adesina however in his reaction, said the move of the lawmakers won’t be successful as they are a minority of minorities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FxZputmJa%2FqnnIpqeemZOduqa602annahdqLKvrdOoqaxlk6S7p8HSnptmmpGXtqa%2FjLCfqGWfo7m6edaapa2dlGKutcDEp6uip55itKK%2BwZpkrKCVncJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
