A fashion entrepreneur, a published author, and a go-getter who seems to have a magic touch, there are several fascinating sides to her.</p><h2>10 interesting facts about Angel Adoree Strawbridge</h2><p class=align-left>If you wish to know more about Angel, here are 10 quick facts about her:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5e2a24bda84d25e7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DStv French Plus package: channel list and subscription cost</span></p></a><h3>1. She was born and raised in Canvey Island</h3><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree was born and raised in Essex, England, in a place known as Canvey Island. Her parents, Stephan Newman and Jennifer Newman used to run a jewellers' shop there, which would result in her falling in love with fashion at a very young age. She also gained a passion for vintage items, which she developed after receiving her first fur jacket at the age of three. She has also attributed this love for vintage things to her mother and grandparents, whom she has described as “incredibly glamorous”.</p><p class=align-left>In Canvey Island, Angel also grew up alongside her brother, Paul Newman. Paul currently runs the family’s jewellers' shop (taking over from his father), which was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relaunched in 2017</a> with the help of Angel.</p><h3>2. Angel Adoree is not her real name</h3><p class=align-left>What is Angel Strawbridge’s real name? She was born as Angela Newman, before adopting the name Angel from her first name. Adoree is her nickname, while the name Strawbridge came from her marriage to her husband, Dick Strawbridge. Born on April 7, 1978, Angel Strawbridge's age is 43 years as of 2021.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/597e308a26dbc14c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>José Bastón biography: net worth, Eva Longoria relationship, children, height</span></p></a><h3>3. She had a passion for vintage things from an early age</h3><p class=align-left>In their teens, most girls are obsessed with their looks, fashion, and things like ponies. However, this was never Angel’s case. At the age of thirteen, her passion for vintage had grown considerably. She would spend her pocket money on vintage clothes and trinkets, which she would acquire from car boot sales and second-hand vintage shops.</p><p class=align-left>In 1995, at just the young age of 17, Angel moved to London, where she set up a vintage clothing and accessories stall in Old Spitalfields Market. The clothing and accessories she sold at the stall were from the vast collection she had created in her teenage years. The vintage stall was her first <a href=#>business</a> venture and the start of her journey into a successful businesswoman.</p><h3>4. She is a successful businesswoman with several ventures to her name</h3><p class=align-left>One of the top things Angel Adoree is known for is her success as a businesswoman. After her vintage clothing stall, Angel did not look back. In 2000, she moved into a converted East London School House. While here, she started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Angel-A Vintage Experience</a>, a one-night-a-month event where her friends and other fashion enthusiasts would come to listen to Jazz, eat delicious foods, drink wine, and try on and buy vintage clothes. The wine, music, laughter, and the overall experience increased sales, making the venture hugely successful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9901888b85902be7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to the original Jake from "State Farm"?

In 2011, she opened the first physical store for the company in Hackney, East London. At the time, the company had a staff of 11 people and would manage more than ten events a week.</p><p class=align-left>Her passion for vintage items and fashion, original and creative ideas, vivacious personality, and a knack for doing business has seen the company boom into a very successful business and famous brand. The business has attracted the attention of fashion designers, brands, and famous people, with top clients including Kim Jones, Cutler and Gross, Paul Smith, just to mention a few. It has also received wide press coverage over the years from newspapers and magazines such as The Independent, Grazia, and Sunday Times Style.</p><h3>5. She is a chartered accountant</h3><p class=align-left>Being a fashion entrepreneur, most people would assume that Angel Adoree went to a fashion school. However, this is not the case. She is a qualified <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">chartered accountant</a> with a background in business studies. In fact, before launching her own company, Angel would spend most of her 9 to 5 days advising businesses and companies on profit and loss.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/51440040cedcb19b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who owns NRG radio?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from her business studies, Adoree is also a trained image consultant. She pursued her studies at the prestigious Aston+Hayes Institute in 2006. The training, combined with her business <a href=#>education</a>, and her love for fashion and vintage things paid off soon after when she launched Vintage Patisserie.</p><h3>6. She has appeared on Dragon’s Den</h3><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree gained fame when she appeared on BBC’s series, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dragons Den</a>. With a desire to grow the Vintage Patisserie brand, she approached the Dragons in 2010 where she pitched her business. The pitch won the investment of Theo Paphitis and Deborah Meaden. However, the partnership failed to come through after the show, but she enjoyed increased visibility and recognition for her brand, which grew it even more. On top of that, she and Deborah <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">became friends</a>, which is alive to this day.</p><h3>7. She is a published author</h3><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree's love for fashion and all things vintage, and her exposure from Dragon’s Den saw her land a book deal shortly after appearing on the show. She is now a published author of the bestselling <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vintage Tea Party series</a>. So far, she has published three books, The Vintage Tea Party (2011), The Vintage Tea Party Year (2012), The Vintage Sweets (2013), which have sold several copies around the <a href=#>world</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4ae849d87d03d93f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All DStv Tanzania packages, channels and prices in 2022</span></p></a><h3>8. She is married to Dick Strawbridge and the couple have two children</h3><p class=align-left>Another thing that Angel Strawbridge gained from her appearance on the Dragon’s Den TV show was an agent. It was the agent who introduced her to her future husband, Dick Strawbridge – whom he also represented.</p><p class=align-left>When Angel and Dick met, it was love at first sight, and the couple hit off and started dating immediately. In 2013, they had their first child - a song, Arthur Donald. The couple welcomed a new member of the <a href=#>family</a> in 2014, their second child and first daughter Dorothy Francis.</p><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree's wedding to her husband was in 2015, and it took place on the couple's family home in Chateau-de-La-Motte-Husson in France. They are happily married and have been living a dream life in France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/597e308a26dbc14c.jpeg><h3>9. She and her family moved to a French Chateau</h3><p class=align-left>Looking for a better life, Angel and Dick Strawbridge left their home and life in London and moved to France. The couple sold their apartment and purchased a 19th-Century chateau in the Pays de la Loire. They managed to get the chateau, which has a massive five stories and astounding forty-five bedrooms for only £280,000. However, it came without electricity, running water, and proper sewage and drainage system. As a result, the couple has spent a good part of their time in France renovating the castle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cbd92fa5a2676af1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Masai Technical Training Institute courses, admissions, and contacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This new chapter of their lives saw the rise of the TV show Escape to the Chateau. Dick Strawbridge, a TV producer, had invited Channel 4 to document their journey as they searched for a house in France. At first, they were looking to purchase a farmhouse, but their budget only allowed for the castle.</p><p class=align-left>The documentary series has since followed the couple in their renovation efforts and has helped to cater for some of the renovation costs in the form of presenter fees paid to the couple. On top of that, they have gained widespread publicity, which has promoted the chateau as a wedding and events venue. Currently, the chateau is available to hire, and they specialize in hosting vintage weddings, retreats, and a range of other special events.</p><h3>10. Angel Strawbridge net worth is estimated to be over £700,000</h3><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree's story is an inspiration, a testament to how one can build something from scratch and be successful. Currently, the Adoree and her husband’s net worth is estimated to be about £700,000. A good chunk of this is from their chateau, which they purchased after selling their London apartment for £400,000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs40o128amso2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of government hospitals in Nairobi</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, with Adoree’s book deal and her Vintage Pattiserrie business which has been hugely successful in previous years, her worth is likely to be higher than that. On top of that, now that their chateau is available for hire, the couple has another very successful stream of revenue.</p><p class=align-left>Angel Adoree from Escape to the Chateau is known for many things, from being a fashion entrepreneur, a businesswoman, an author, a wife and mother, and more. However, the thing that she is perhaps famous for is her love for fashion and vintage and her great personality that has endeared her to millions of people in the UK and around the world. Angel Adoree Strawbridge is successful in her venture and that is proof that you can do just about anything as long as you have the will and desire to succeed.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Dick Strawbridge net worth, family, wealth, chateau</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs5b7roi6va6e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Flora Mutahi biography: family & career</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> also posted an article about <a href=#>Dick Strawbridge</a>.
