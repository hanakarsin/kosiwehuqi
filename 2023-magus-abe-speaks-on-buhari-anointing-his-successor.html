It is called premature ejaculation. That is what is happening in the All Progressives Congress here in Rivers State.</p><p>“Nothing has happened, people are already making themselves happy. They are going around telling people that President Buhari has appointed his successor. I am a member of the All Progressives Congress, I want to stand here and tell you people that I am not aware that the president has nominated anybody to be President. Nobody and that is not what I think is the plan of this party.</p><p>“This party plans to ensure that party members will have the opportunity to pick who will succeed President Buhari as the flag-bearer of the party.”</p><p>He noted that in the next few months, all the noise by some members of the party would cease.</p><p>Abe called on members of the ruling party to continue their grassroots mobilization in the interest of the party ahead of the election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49uZmtoYmh6rq3GrqpmmZKaerS8xJqirGWfo3qjwceaqaJlkaO8qrrToqWgZZiewG6%2F1JyanqujpL9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
