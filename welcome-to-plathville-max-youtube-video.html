Max met the rest of the Plath clan the same year, making his debut in Season 2, Episode 5 of Welcome to Plathville. But the couple recently broke up. What happened? Why did Max delete his YouTube videos?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TLC</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Max, Moriah Plath's ex-boyfriend, has deleted all of his YouTube videos, ahead of Season 4, Episode 6 of 'Welcome to Plathville.'</h2><p>Max and Moriah dated for about a year, announcing their breakup in November 2021. A new episode of <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville</a> casts light on the lesser-known aspects of their split, tackling the flurry of emotions Max stirred up by posting a YouTube video explaining why things between him and Moriah ended earlier in 2022. Max might have cleaned his YouTube channel in anticipation of the episode.</p><p>Max opened up about his breakup with Moriah in Season 4 of <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville</a>. As he told <a href=#>Micah Plath</a>, he cheated on Moriah â€” thereby sealing the fate of his relationship with Moriah and the rest of the family.</p><p>Max joined YouTube in August 2020. In February 2022, he posted a YouTube video detailing what went down between him and Moriah after they joined Olivia Plath and Ethan Plath in Tampa, Fla. Season 4, Episode 6 of Welcome to Plathville directly looks at the fallout from his social media activities.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>As Max seems to have suggested in the now-deleted video, he and Moriah fought quite frequently during the last stages of the relationship. He said they were increasingly unable to communicate transparently with each other.</p><p>Max told Micah on Welcome to Plathville that he only shared a brief, unserious kiss with another woman. He seems to have insinuated that she was the one to initiate the proceedings.</p><p>Moriah shared her side of the story in a Welcome to Plathville episode, suggesting that the incident involved slightly more than a humble peck on the cheek. "He said it was just a kiss, but it turned out to be more than that," Moriah told Micah. "It made me feel worthless, for sure," Moriah added in a confessional.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>"It made me feel like I had poured everything that I had of my heart ... to be treated like I could just be traded for anything," Moriah said. "I feel stupid because it's like, I should've known. It just hurts so bad because it's like I feel like I gave him everything I had and then as soon as I moved to Tampa it's like ... I'm just gonna do that."</p><p>"I'm scared to share what happened with anybody because once I say it out loud it becomes real," Moriah added. "And I don't know what's gonna happen with us. I just know I right now I need to focus on healing because he really hurt me."</p><p>New episodes of Welcome To Plathville air Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKtr86mnGasn2K9ra3Toa2ipJyaeq6t12awqK2kqq%2BmedWim56n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
