Garba, admit it, you and your government are thoroughly shameless. Without paying anyone one kobo, I was able to sustain Harass Buhari out of London for days and we will continue. Shame on you.</p><p>“Shame on General Buhari, their so-called ‘solidarity rally’ for Buhari at Abuja House flopped, with only 5 people turning up, despite the £75 per head they paid. El-Rufai is this the best you guys can do to counter #HarassBuhariOutofLondon.
