This studio is well renowned for such series as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-On!; and received a widely acclaimed standalone feature termed as A Silent Voice in 2016. Netflix took up the streaming rights to Violet Evergarden, a series made in KyoAni, and made it accessible and available globally.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ca2854035efbc07f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who my successor will be - Buhari speaks to Nigerians in first tweet after lifting Twitter suspension</span></p></a><p class=align-left>KyoAni is well reputed for its top-quality animation that has a distinct visual style. It is also considered among the most hospitable workplaces for anyone in the famously demanding anime industry in Japan. Dissimilar to all other studios, the firm employs animators like salaried workers who are usually not paid per frame.</p><p class=align-left>The Kyoto Animation Fire is a catastrophe that hit Japan and the studio to be precise. Owed to its competence in the field, it is a sure thing that it will bounce back and continue producing anime series and films for their fans.</p><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Egungun festival turns battle in Oyo as 3 feared dead, other injured</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOAmHFvb2Wbrry1u4yapaKlkam2sLqMn6CrnV2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYravr8idnKesXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
