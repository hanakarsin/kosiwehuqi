Ever since we first met the duo in Season 4, their relationship has been tainted with deceit and turmoil.</p><p>Despite the pair’s rocky start, they’ve managed to survive two seasons of the spinoff, 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? But are they still going strong in 2019? Scroll down for an update on the reality TV twosome.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Pedro and Chantel from 90 Day Fiancé still together?</h2><p>The couple, who met while Chantel was on a trip to the Dominican Republic, is still married. In fact, they just scored their own spinoff on TLC titled The Family Chantel. The brunette beauty’s parents and siblings will feature prominently in the series as will Pedro’s mom and sister.</p><p>"Our fans can’t get enough of Pedro, Chantel, and their larger-than-life families," president and general manager of TLC, Howard Lee, said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> announcing the new spinoff. "For a brand known as the destination for love, relationships, and family shows, The Family Chantel hits the bulls eye."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After the news became public, Chantel thanked followers for their kind words <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>. "I have been getting so much support from my followers about the announcement of #thefamilychantel and I am so grateful," she wrote.</p><p>"Initially I was ambivalent about it because my life is not perfect and it is not easy to show my flaws to the world. Thank you to the people who have been sending me support."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chantel sparked split rumors in September with a cryptic social media post.</h2><p>Just seven months ago, fans thought the duo was headed for a divorce when Chantel shared a surprising quote on her Instagram stories. "Sometimes the hardest part of being a great catch is accepting not everyone’s hands are strong enough to hold you," the text read.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The nursing student was also photographed several times without her engagement ring. Some fans were on board with the possibility of a breakup. "You deserve a man who will treat you like a queen," one follower wrote. “You are beautiful you don't need all the stress from your in-laws and a man who does not respect your family."</p><p>Others were eager to see the pair work things out. "I'm so rooting for Pedro and Chantel," one user commented. "That man loves her, but both of their families keep interfering. Her family keeps putting things in her head, and his family keeps digging into his pockets knowing that they are a young couple just starting out."</p><p>Another fan added, "I hope for peace and no more fist fights," referring to Pedro’s previous altercations with Chantel’s family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>By October, the Georgia native was posing with her ring again — though she didn’t share another photo of her hubby until March of this year.</p><p>Not convinced you want to watch this twosome spar on their own show?
