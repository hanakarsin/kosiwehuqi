Law enforcement is not done by emotion or sentiment but on hard core evidence, empirically tested to be credible. Now that Miss. Tonto Dike has denied ever appearing in that allegedly forged photograph on the social media, NDLEA should leave this lady alone and go after big barons”.</p><p>NDLEA spokesman Mr. Mitchell Ofoyeju had stated thus; “Our attention has been drawn to the post quite frankly and I can tell you that action will be taken on it. The law is clear and NDLEA has been very clear on the issue. No one is permitted to sell, use, cultivate or encourage the use of Indian hemp in Nigeria. The substance is one of the banned narcotics in the country.”</p><p>But HURIWA faulted the move saying that the allegation against Miss. Tonto Dike at best amounted to ‘tissue of speculative contraption’ which should not attract the attention of any serious-minded law enforcement agency except if it has run out of idea on how to pursue and arrest high profile drug barons who have flooded major streets of state capitals with hard drugs leading to serial addictions by the Nigerian youth.</p><p>The Rights group said; “NDLEA is being clever by half by stating that it will arrest and jail Miss. Tonto Dike based on mere untenable evidence of marijuana photograph on the social media.</p><p>Why did the NDLEA fail to seek public clarification from the Borno state governor who was reported in a section of the media to have alleged that drug addicts are in his cabinet? Why is NDLEA after this lady? Is it because she is a woman whereas it has not bothered to look the way of the Borno state governor that alleged the presence of drug addicts in the state cabinet nor has the agency gone after the international musicians who appear regularly in the Nigerian media puffing what looks like marijuana?”</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHmEkmxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
