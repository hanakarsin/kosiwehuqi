Of course, they are aware that they have a bad case in the tribunal and are doing everything possible to take Andy Uba and APC out from the tribunal, but they will fail.</p><p>“We are not surprised that APGA members are celebrating the Justice Ekwo judgement like a child that received Christmas clothe from his father. They believe that the judgement will stop Andy Uba from proving his petition at the tribunal. The good thing is that this is not the last court in this instant. We are heading to appeal court to prove them wrong.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> earlier reported that the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, had <strong><a href=#>ruled that Senator Andy Uba is not a valid candidate of the APC</a></strong> for the 2021 Anambra governorship election held on November 6.</p><p>The court in a ruling on Monday by the presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo said the APC didn’t conduct a valid primary election.</p><p>Ekwo further instructed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to delete all records about Uba’s participation in the Anambra governorship polls from its records.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FpZpqmkaKvs62MprBmnZ2av6ixzZycZpmjYq6xr4ygpq%2BdoqO8s7%2FHoqdmm5GjsaqwwK2cZqSVnK6tedSbmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
