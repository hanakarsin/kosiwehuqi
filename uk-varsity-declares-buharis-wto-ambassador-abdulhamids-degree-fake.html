According to the school in a statement which copy was made available to newsmen on Monday, the WTO ambassador did not graduate from the institution and was never a student.</p><p>The statement read partly: “The individual you mention (sic) is not known to us and has not been a student with us at any time,” the institution said in an email.</p><p>It also stated that students are not directly admitted into the institution, as it lacks degree awarding powers.</p><p>“London Graduate School is the delivery arm of OTHM Qualifications, the UK regulated awarding body and as such we do not take students directly. We do not have degree-awarding powers however we provide Top-up Degrees validated and awarded by our partner, the University of Chichester as published on the University website,” the institution added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BrZq6jXauus7%2FIrbBmnJWYuaK%2BxKxkm62Ylr%2Bqv4ywq6hlkaKvor%2FSmpuoql2Wr6XBy6GYpqGUqHqlscarnJ5llpa4pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
