The whole process is tailored to help students acquire certain subjects for their study. It’s important to understand that curriculum implementation in Nigeria is not possible without students.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>KPMG recruitment for graduates</p><p class=align-left>Let’s take a look at the top 8 factors that affect curriculum implementation in Nigeria</p><h3>Top 8 factors for curriculum implementation</h3><h3>8. Teachers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3jslb2kl3nmg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Teachers are the first people to implement their role in the curriculum for their students. They usually select what they need to teach to their students and how it may affect the whole teaching process. Therefore, their curriculum is provided to be alternative as teachers may decide what they want to teach and what the really need to teach.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f19a51346b459a26.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Restructuring Nigeria’s overbloated academic curricular by Moshood Olajide (opinion)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Teachers are usually involved in constructing and implementation of curriculum in Nigeria.</p><h3>7. Learners</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f19a51346b459a26.jpeg><p class=align-left>Learners may also influence the curriculum implementation in Nigeria. If teachers are provided to be the arbiters of the learning process, but the learners actually hold the key to the idea of curriculum activity. The official learning process is quite different from the one that is prescribed by the ideas of country.</p><h3>6. Resource Materials and Facilities</h3><p class=align-left>It’s obvious that no meaningful teaching process can be provided without resources and facilities. This factor significantly changes the whole picture of what happens right now. The Ministry of Education has problems providing necessary resources to the all educational institutions in Nigeria. In some schools, students have to pay for their books and even supply their schools with necessary equipment.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, the implementation of curriculum is impossible without providing necessary elements for education. Rural areas especially suffer from the lack of resources.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2fff90ac765a7cc9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The future belongs to creators, says Rotimi Bankole as he launches SBI Media Workshop</span></p></a><h3>5. Interest Groups</h3><p class=align-left>The interest group also play the major role in the development and implementation of curriculum in Nigeria. Who are these groups that may have influence on the development of curriculum in our country? They are usually holders of great financial resources and may influence the political structure of our country.</p><p class=align-left>The curriculum may also be outdated and their implementation are not necessary and even harmful in some cases.</p><h3>4. The School Environment</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7l45k067hp8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Implementation of curriculum is also affected by the school environment. For instance, if a school located in a quiet and pleasant socioeconomic area, then this school may implement some extracurricular activities that can be suited for the people of that area.</p><p class=align-left>At the same time, if a school is situated in not the best place on earth then it’s highly possible that the school may change the whole curriculum to support the interest of learners. Therefore, the school environment may decide if they need to follow the curriculum.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e0348d7fcba49f1b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>School resumption: Lagos releases calendar for 2020/2021 session</span></p></a><h3>3. Culture and Ideology</h3><p class=align-left>Culture and ideology may also change the implementation of curriculum in schools. Culture differences are present in different parts of the country and even in the same school. Therefore, culture may provide various interesting decisions in implementing curriculum in Nigeria.</p><h3>2. Instructional Supervision</h3><p class=align-left>Implementation of curriculum is not possible without supervisory functions provided by the government.</p><h3>1. Assessment</h3><p class=align-left>Examination changes the way you think about curriculum. It provides new standards to meet and all educational institutions will have an opportunity to meet these standards or change them accordingly.</p><p class=align-left>The implementation of curriculum is possible in many ways. Nevertheless, it’s advised to consider every possible factor that can affect curriculum implementation in order to develop effective curriculum for education.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nigeria Police recruitment 2018 begins: date and requirements</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKClm5va2WWlrC1u9GsZJqelpqwtbXNoGScraKntqTBy66kZqGdpbmmucSnq5qsmaS7brrIoJyroZFjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
