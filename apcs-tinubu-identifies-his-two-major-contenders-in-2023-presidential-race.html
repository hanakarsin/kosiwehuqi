The Northern elders publicly disassociated themselves from the comment and Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has as well called on Atiku to apologize for the gaffe.</p><h2>You Are A Divider</h2><p>In his interaction with the sect leaders today, Shettima said, “Between all of us running (sic), we are three now left. Isn’t it? One just failed the most important part of the examination. Are you a unifier or a divider? He said ‘I am from the North. You are a divider.”</p><p>The APC Vice Presidential candidate also claimed that PDP had spent $16billion on electricity in its 16 years rule but failed to address the situation of epileptic power supply.</p><p>“I am reminding you that you don’t need a party who has served 16 years and forget that electricity is the only driver of industrialization and wealth of every nation.</p><p>“They spent $16bn and we are still paying for estimated metre and billing. No more!</p><p>“I promise to give you 100 not 50, even Dubai they are talking about has only 50. So you will have it better from me than in Dubai,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FsZpqok6h6tbXNrpmuZZmZsq%2FAyJ%2Bgnqtdnba0edOwpmalkZ%2B8s3nCqKWtnZ6ZsrO%2FjKKlZmpgZ4BuvNGeqqKclaPBqq3LZqmam5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
