The show gets its intriguing name from the main subject of the podcast John B. McLemore's description of Woodstock, Alabama.</p><p>Goodson is now <a href=#>dead at a young age</a>. So what happened to him? Details are ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: S-Town Martha</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Joseph Tyler Goodson since 'S-Town' ended? His life took a tragic turn.</h2><p>After the creation of the Peabody awarding-winning podcast in 2017, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News</a>, McLemore, a local antique restorer, died by suicide. As for Goodson, he was later arrested for allegedly stealing items from the father figure's property.</p><p>The late star later said that the items actually belonged to him.</p><p>But sadly, his troubles didn't end there, with Goodson ending up dead following a standoff with the Woodstock Police Department at the 32-year-old's home. As the news outlet reports, he allegedly had a gun, and was waving it around.</p><p>That's when he was shot by police, some three hours after the standoff began. Goodson, tragically, did not survive his injuries.</p><p>It's unclear why <a href=#>law enforcement was called</a> to his home initially before the horrible incident ensued. Meanwhile, before his death, the podcast star took to social media to describe what was happening as the tense series of events played out.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AL.com</a>, Goodson posted to Facebook Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023, "Police 'bout to shoot me down in my own yard.‚Äô‚Äô</p><p>In a statement about the incident, and the <a href=#>small town resident's death</a>, Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in part, ‚ÄúI know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included. Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast."</p><p>‚ÄúPlease remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many," Dodson added.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Very sad news. I remember him as a good friend to John McLemore and a sympathetic, troubled young man in S-Town, possibly the best podcast series I ever listened to.<a href=#>https://t.co/kXGtiG4OP1</a></p>‚Äî Peaches üçë (@MrsAlSwearengen) <a href=#>December 5, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are reacting to what happened to Joseph Tyler Goodson on social media.</h2><p>As news broke that Goodson was dead, listeners of the podcast he starred in took to X to share their thoughts.</p><p>One person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that S-Town "somehow got weirder."</p><p>Many people are inspired to revisit the podcast, with several fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">noting</a> that it's "the best podcast ever."</p><p>Sadly, some folks aren't surprised by what happened given how the town and its residents are portrayed on the show. As someone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on X, S-Town has turned into an s-show."</p><p>Dozens of other commenters expressed their condolences for Goodson and his family.
